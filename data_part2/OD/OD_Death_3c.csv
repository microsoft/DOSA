Story0,"Title: A Final Journey in Odisha

In the heart of the green, vibrant Indian state of Odisha, lived a humble fisherman, Bhadra. A member of the domineering Khandayat caste, he was known for his kindness and spirit of hospitality. His life, a symphony of austere rituals and devout beliefs intertwined with the smell of nature and echoes of the Mahanadi River, had a profound tranquillity. 

On a sultry August evening, Bhadra unexpectedly passed away, plunging his family and the quaint little village into grief. As per the tradition of the Khandayat caste, the mourning commenced at his humble abode with the dakhina ceremony. Bhadra's eldest son, Kapil, performed the rites, shrouded in sorrow.

The women of the family, draped in plain white sarees, their faces reflecting the anguish of loss, began the solemn aarti. The whole house reverberated with poignant hymns, while the neighbors thronged the small courtyard to pay their last respects. Bhadra’s lifeless form, wrapped in a khandua, the ceremonial cloth, lay on richly fragrant tulsi leaves - a gesture that signified his return to mother nature.

The next morning, the village woke up to a sombre procession led by Kapil. Bearing Bhadra on a bamboo-bier on his shoulder, his eyes were welled up but determined. As per the tradition, the procession stopped at the village's cherished peepal tree, considered sacred. Underneath its vast shade, Kapil was given a handful of hard barley grains, which he smashed with a stone, symbolizing the breaking of earthly ties his father once had. 

Then began the final walk to the cremation ground, locally known as “Mahasamsana Yogana.” The village men followed Kapil, chanting prayers, while the women bid adieu from afar. The rite of surrounding the pyre seven times before lighting it, known as Saptapadi, was performed. Each round signified a prayer to the elements - earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, and moon, to purify Bhadra's soul.

The pyre was finally lit, and the flames rose, engulfing Bhadra, rendering him one with the elements. Kapil, a tear trickling down his cheek, recited the “moksha mantra”, requesting his father's soul to attain liberation. The villagers, sharing the family's grief, silently watched until the fire diminished into a silent glow.

Three days later, amidst the family's unbroken mourning, the ashes and remains were carefully gathered and released into the serene Mahanadi. This ritual, known as ""Asthi Visarjan"", symbolized Bhadra's return to the cosmic. A week later, Kapil performed the ""Shradh"" rites, offering ""pinda-daan"" to symbolize a peaceful journey of his father's soul to the afterlife.

Bhadra's death marked his departure from the earthly realm, but he continued to live in the customs and traditions he had nurtured. The rituals that unfolded through his death served as a testament of the village's unity and its deep-rooted belief in the concept of life, death, and beyond.

In the end, Bhadra’s death was not just about sorrow and loss; it was equally about acceptance, ritualistic solace, and the promise of a deep spiritual journey onto another realm - elements intricately mingled in the tapestry of Odisha's divine culture.

Story1,"Title: A Widow's Promise

The quaint village of Bihangaon in Odisha was usually obscured by serenity. However, a gloomy day marked the death of Mahadev, a revered blacksmith belonging to the Kansari caste, adding a tinge of sorrow to the calm milieu. 

Mahadev, a man of strength and precision, had lived a modest life with his devoted wife, Kaveri. She was a Gouda, a caste historically known as cowherders. They were a symbol of inter-caste unity, revered and respected by everyone in the rural society. 

According to Kansari and Gouda caste customs, death was a sacred phase requiring due reverence and ritualistic rights. Kaveri, clad in a white saree, her face bearing the depth of loss, took up the responsibility of the somber rites under the guidance of the village priest.

The lifeless body of Mahadev was bathed and then dressed in new garments. Embarking on his final journey from his cherished anvil and hammer, Mahadev was placed atop a bamboo bier, decorated with marigold garlands. The village men carried him through the snaking lanes towards the local cremation ground.

Stopping by the sacred Banyan tree, the village priest performed the Bhoota Shuddhi ritual. This ritual aimed at purifying the soul and severing its earthly connection, aiding it in a peaceful transition to the afterlife.

Once at the cremation ground, a pyre was arranged using specific types of wood, including sandalwood, to represent the five elements-earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Kaveri, after lighting a torch from the village temple's flame, handed it over to the eldest son of Mahadev. He then set the pyre ablaze, the ascending smoke ostensibly carrying Mahadev to the havens. 

Back at home, Kaveri carried out the observance of mourning, or 'Asaucha,' which lasted for ten days. During this time, she refrained from daily chores and spent her time in prayers, seeking peace for Mahadev's departed soul.

On the eleventh day, Kaveri initiated the 'teeta eeta' ceremony. She replaced the earthen pot kept beside her bed for ten days with an urn with organic remnants from the cremation ground. It marked Mahadev’s existence in spirit and kept him engrained in the family.

The final formal condolence meet, 'Bhrutya,' was held forty days after death. Kaveri, remaining strong for her family, acknowledged condolences and shared food prepared according to Mahadev's liking with the community. This act commemorated his existence among them, providing closure to Kaveri and her family.

Mahadev's death was shrouded in sorrow, yet the rituals and traditions followed by Kaveri reflected acceptance and an unwavering faith in the circle of life and death. They reestablished the belief that death, while heartbreaking, is also about celebrating the spiritual legacy left behind and nurturing hope in the heart of despair."
Story2,"Title: Pathway to Eternity

In the coastal town of Puri, known for the Jagannath temple that adorns its soil, resided a humble Brahmin named Jagan. A scholarly figure, he had spent his life in the service of the Lord and the community. However, at the ripe age of ninety-four, Jagan peacefully succumbed to mortality, leaving the town in deep mourning.

In the Brahmin tradition, Jagan's eldest son Narayan was to carry out the death rites. With a heavy heart and a resolute mind, he commenced the ritual known as 'Antyesti' or 'last sacrifice.' The women of the household prepared the body, bathing it, dressing it in a white cloth, and placing it on a palna, a bamboo bed designed for the final journey.

The ritual procession headed from Jagan's home to the Swargadwara crematorium by the sea. Narayan carried a brass pot filled with the holy water of the Ganga, diligently making holes in it to allow the water to drip throughout the journey, symbolizing the soul's departure from the body.

On reaching the crematorium, a pyre was prepared. Jagan's body was carefully placed upon it, positioned with his head to the north. As per the Brahmin ritual, Narayan took an earthen pot filled with water, made three horizontal circles around the pyres, and broke the pot behind him before lighting up the pyre. The cracking sound echoed across the crematorium, symbolizing the breaking of ties with the mortal world.

As the fire consumed Jagan's mortal shell, Narayan performed the 'Kapalakriya,' cracking the skull using a bamboo stick, signifying the soul's formal release to the afterlife. This intense ritual resonated deeply with the reality of mortality and the impermanence of human existence.

Once the ashes cooled, they were respectfully collected the next day for the 'Asthi Sanchaya.' Following the traditional path leading to the convergence of the rivers Bhargavi and Ganga, Narayan, accompanied by his siblings, dispersed the ashes. This poignant act indicated the return of the elements to the cosmos and the soul's journey onward.

Twelve days after death, the 'Sapindikaranam' was held, marking the assimilation of Jagan's soul with the ancestral spirits. Cooked rice balls were offered, merging three into one, indicating the deceased's transformation from a preta, a spirit, to a pitr, an ancestor.

Finally, on the thirteenth day, a ceremonial feast, 'Brahmana Bhojana,' was arranged, where all villagers were invited to partake, marking the end of the mourning period. Jagan remained etched in their memories and in the principles he had lived by.

Jagan's death underscored the impact of age-old rituals and the belief in life after death. His journey showed that while death might be the end of physical existence, it is also a transcendental event, opening a pathway to everlasting eternity."
Story3,"Title: Journey to Eternity - A Mundari’s Rite

In the dense forest of Mayurbhanj district in Odisha, amongst the indigenous Mundari tribe, celebration and mourning often walk hand in hand. 

Chakradhar, a respected figure amongst the Munda tribe and a master bowman, succumbed to an ailment, leaving the tribe in profound sorrow. His young son, Tiria, was entrusted with the responsibility of the final rites, according to the Munda customs.

Chakradhar's body was bathed and wrapped in a traditional dress, his face smeared with red ocher, symbolic of vitality and strength. His bow and arrows were placed beside him; after all, they were a warrior’s companions, even in death.

The morning after, the men of the tribe gallantly carried the bier, accompanied by the rhythmic beats of Mandar, a traditional drum, and the echoing pain in the tribal songs. Reverence adorned the atmosphere, and stoicism blanketed Tiria's young yet resolute countenance. 

The procession charted its path towards a forest patch, specifically designated as the cremation ground. Stopovers were made at significant places during Chakradhar's life, including the river where he first learned to swim and the banyan tree under which he wooed his wife. 

At the cremation ground, his body was placed upon a wooden pyre, his possessions around him. As per the tradition, Tiria set the pyre ablaze, and the flames soared high, casting elongated shadows of the tribe members in the fading evening light.

For the following week, the tribe observed mourning, refraining from their daily chores. They spent leisure time reminiscing about Chakradhar's valor and his tales of courage. On the tenth day, the tribe gathered and Tiria led a procession to collect the ashes that were later immersed in the village's sacred stream. This act, known as 'Phulmati,' symbolized the release and return of Chakradhar's essence to nature.

The culmination of the mourning period was known as ‘Giti Phaguna.’ Some young tribal men enacted brave hunts of Chakradhar, while women sang emotional songs of loss. A communal feast was prepared, and the tribal drink, ‘Handia,’ was shared, a symbolic continuation of community bonding that Chakradhar always fostered. This gathering marked the end of the mourning period and the beginning of acceptance, both of Chakradhar's departure and his timeless existence.

Chakradhar’s passage to the afterlife, though dipped in grief, reflected the strength and unity of the Mundari tribe. Their belief in the journey beyond mortality and the subsequent acceptance of their reality painted a vivid canvas of life, loss, and the resilience of tradition. It left an indelible mark of faith and kinship, resonating through the serene forest of Mayurbhanj for times to come.

Story4,"Title: Guidance to the Beyond: An Oraon Tribute

The village of Similipal, nestled in the hills of Odisha, is majorly inhabited by the Oraon Tribe - families of earthy, joyous people who deeply respect nature's cycles and transitions, including death. Kisan, a beloved elder of the Oraon tribe, lost his battle to old age one uneventful afternoon, leaving the village cloaked in grief. 

Kisan's youngest but the most courageous son, Birsa, was tasked with the death rites and rituals. The transition began with the women of the house, pressing the aging temples of the departed with fresh clay, an act symbolizing the relief from worldly burdens. The body was then bathed using sacred water with neem extracts, purifying the deceased before their journey to the afterlife.

The men, led by Birsa, then carried the body through the village, inviting everyone to join them in their mourning. They made their way towards the cremation ground, the sacred site under the ancient Sal trees, humming spiritual folk songs to guide Kisan's soul. 

On reaching the bereavement ground, they carefully built the funeral pyre with the Sal tree's wood. Birsa was then handed a flaming torch to set the pyre ablaze. The cracking sounds of the fire and ancient hymns filled the air, ushering Kisan's soul gently into the afterlife.

The following day, young virgins from the tribe, symbolizing purity, carried an earthen pot filled with water to the cremation site. From the ashes, they fashioned a clay statue known as 'Karma Putli,' symbolizing Kisan's soul, which they vigiled over for nine days, offering prayers and food. 

On the tenth day, the 'Athanga' ceremony took place, where the Karma Putli was carried back to Kisan's house, allowing the soul one final visit. With chants of ancestral names, the Oraons escorted Kisan's symbolic form to the sacred river. The clay idol was immersed with great respect, signifying Kisan's final departure, his spirit becoming one with the universe.

For the Oraon tribe, the death of Kisan was not just a time of grief and mourning but a transition to a higher realm. The rituals held a deep spiritual significance, acknowledging the fluctuating nature of life and death. They exemplified a profound message: death isn't just an end but an essential aspect of the cycle of life, a journey to the divine beyond.

Story5,"Title: ""Hymns and Homage""

Ramachandra, a diligent farmer from the agrarian Kurmi community of the Bargarh district in Odisha, passed away peacefully one mild winter afternoon, leaving his family and the village in collective sorrow.

As per the Kurmi's age-old customs, Ramachandra's eldest son, Keshab, steeped in grief yet dignified, took upon the mantle to perform the obligatory death rituals. The rites commenced with Ramachandra's body being bathed in holy water from the village well and then dressed in a traditional kurta and dhoti. His body was adorned with Tulsi beads representing the sacred purity.

Escorted by Keshab, the villagers, donned in plain white, carried Ramachandra's body on a bamboo bier to the holy bank of Jira River. An elderly townswoman, revered for her life-long devotion to spirituality, led the procession, chanting hymns from the Bhagavad Gita, instilling solace and acceptance into grieving hearts.

The cremation ground on the river bank, considered sanctified by generations of Kurmi ancestors, welcomed the procession with an air of melancholy. Arrangements for the funeral pyre were swiftly facilitated by the villagers, who had gathered with teary eyes and heavy hearts.

Keshab lit the pyre, and as the flames leaped upwards, they quietly observed the 'Ekodishta,' a ritualistic silence, believing that the silence would guide Ramachandra's soul peacefully into the afterlife. The solemnity of smoke ascending to the cloudless sky held everyone’s gaze before it dispersed into the ether, just as they believed Ramachandra's spirit had.

On the third day after the cremation, Keshab gathered the ashes, now a symbol of Ramachandra's earthly life, for the ritual known as 'Asthi Visarjan.' He gently dispersed the ashes into Jira River, marking a cleansing and a connect with the cosmic energy. 

The twelve-day mourning period culminated with the ritual called 'Pranita Bhojan.' A feast open to the entire village, cooked by the women of Ramachandra's family, was served in his honor. It was a session of shared stories that celebrated Ramachandra, a concoction of fond laughter and grief.

In losing Ramachandra, the village had not only lost a loved community member but also a part of its shared harmony. Still, they found solace in the journey they helped him undertake into his spiritual continuation. The death ritual acted as collective therapy, a healing balm to the wounds of loss, underscoring the idea of death not only as an end but also as an enduring symbol of transitioning into an unseen yet deeply believed world."
Story6,"Title: An End and a Beginning: The Ollar Death Ritual

Located in the verdant hills of Odisha is the remote Ollar tribe, a small community known for their close-knit relations and harmonious lifestyle. When Aadi, an elderly member of the tribe bid adieu to the world, it was a time of both sorrow and profound spiritual reflection. 

Aadi's death plunged the tribe into a solemn quiet. His son, Bhima, orchestrated the death rituals handed down through generations. The rites began with bathing Aadi's body with a mixture of turmeric and water, symbolising purification.

Wrapped in a traditional hand-loomed cotton shroud, Aadi’s body was carefully placed on a bamboo bier. The villagers moved together in a slowly winding procession towards the village cremation ground, an ancient banyan tree standing guard. This journey was accompanied by the rhythmic beats of Dhap, a traditional drum, capturing the cyclical symmetry of life and death.

Bhima painstakingly arranged the funeral pyre, with logs from the Sal tree, symbolising strength and durability. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, Aadi's body was placed on the pyre, and Bhima, holding back his tears, set it ablaze. The dance of the flames mirrored the tribe's mixed emotions – grief at the loss, but relief at the release of Aadi's soul from the confines of his aged body.

The third day dawned, and the villagers gathered again. Bhima collected the ashes, now a symbol of his father's earthly existence. With a silent prayer, he released them into the sacred Kua River, a gesture of returning to the cosmic cycle and the continuity of life and death.

The mourning period lasted for ten days, during which the Ollars refrained from any form of festivity. A shared kinship of loss, memories, grief, and solace pulsated through each tribesman, turning individual mourning into collective catharsis.

On the thirteenth day, the tribe held an elaborate feast or 'Sraddha.' The village cook prepared Aadi’s favourite dishes, which were then served to the entire community. They spent the occasion sharing stories of Aadi, their voices laced with melancholy but also fond smiles.

For the Ollar Tribe, Aadi’s death was a passage, a cyclic return to the grand cosmic theatre. The pain was real, so was the loss, but the tradition provided them a way to navigate it - a path to transform personal grief into shared resilience.

Amidst the serene fishing hamlets in the coastline of Ganjam, Odisha, dwells the Kharwar community, fishing folk known for their deep respect for the sea, their life's provider. When Kalia, the oldest fisherman of the village, died, their lives were enveloped in a profound sense of loss, and the sea seemed to share their sorrow, its waves mirroring their melancholy.

At the cremation ground, the pyre was meticulously organized with logs of Baba tree, considered sacred in their culture. Kalia was laid upon it, his worn-out fishing net spread over him, a tribute to his lifelong friend, the sea. As Madan lit the pyre, the flames leapt skyward, leaving behind a trail of smoky farewell to Kalia.

The twelve-day mourning period marked dimmed lamps and quiet prayers in every house, the silence only interrupted by the routine roar of the sea waves. On the tenth day, a ritual - Asthi Sanchayan was observed. Madan collected his father's ashes and gently submerged them into the Bay of Bengal, symbolizing Kalia's final return to his beloved sea.

However, when Kundan breathed his last, the eerie silence his death left behind echoed in the hearts of each tribe member.

His son, Ravi, was entrusted with performing the death rituals in accordance with Ghasi clan traditions. After the women washed and prepared Kundan’s body, it was adorned with traditional tribal attire and a garland of wildflowers that reflected Kundan’s love for nature.

At the cremation ground, Ravi and others carefully arranged a pyre under the ancient peepal tree. As the twilight solemnly witnessed, the pyre was set alight with the flaming torch. As Kundan’s mortal remains were consumed by flames, prayers were sung, guiding his soul towards a peaceful transition.

The ashes from the pyre were meticulously collected by Ravi the next morning. The tribe then took a journey to the serene flow of the Kolab River, where the ashes were dispersed. This ritual, known as ""Asthi Visarjan,"" facilitated Kundan’s spirit to merge with the elemental cosmos.

Kundan's death echoed the fragility of life, but the rituals marked his passage into another realm as harmonious as his music.

Story15,"Title: Symphony of the Bells, A Kela Story

Nestled within the picturesque landscapes of Odisha’s Rayagada district, lives the Kela tribe, revered for their rhythmic dance and rich folk music. When their adored music teacher, Mohan, succumbed to illness, it painted their vibrant lives with a shade of grief. The jovial sound of ankle bells fell to a mournful silence.

His niece, Radha, undeterred by the prevailing sadness, took up the mantle to perform the traditional Kela death rituals. Mohan's body was bathed in the holy river water mixed with turmeric and dressed in his favorite dancing attire, his ankle bells clasped around his feet for one last time.

Radha led the funeral procession from Mohan's house to the village crematorium. The Kelas, with heavy hearts, sang their ancestral funeral ballads, their voices imbued with love for their departed mentor. 

Once at the cremation grounds, the villagers formed a circle around the carefully-made pyre consisting of three types of wood, including mango, neem, and banyan. Under the soft glow of the setting sun, Radha lit the pyre, each spark a tribute to her dear uncle. As the flames danced, the villagers’ voices rose in a final hymn, their tears mingling freely with the evening dew.

Following the cremation, the tribe observed nine days of mourning, practicing restraint from their usual revelry of dance and music. Radha placed a small bowl of Mohan’s favorite dishes near his dance ground during this phase, a practice known as 'Shraadh.' This was a humble offering to appease Mohan’s spirit and help it attain peace.

On the tenth day, called 'Dasgaatra,' Radha invited the village to a commemorative feast at Mohan's house. Everyone shared his memories and stories over a hearty meal, slowly healing the wounds of his loss.

That same day, at the twilight hour, the villagers assembled at their dance ground. Then, as though on cue, they danced, their ankle bells echoing Mohan’s tunes, his memories wafting symbolically with the ripples of their music under the star-studded sky.

Mohan’s death, although sorrowful, offered an opportunity to pay homage to his life and talents. Through their rituals, the Kela tribe preserved the belief in life’s cyclical nature and that death, while an end, is also merely a prologue to a broader cosmic dance of existence.

Story16,"Title: Farewell with Feathers: A Bondo Tribe's Parting 

Nested amidst the hills of Malkangiri, Odisha, the secluded Bondo tribe upheld its unique customs for generations. Their lives were a tapestry woven by nature. The passing of Meena, a much-revered community elder, plunged the tribe into a solemn dirge of loss and reflection.

Traditionally, Meena's son, Bhima, was bestowed with the responsibility of carrying out the death rituals. Preparations for her last rites began at dawn, as the women of the village bathed and dressed her in a 'ringa,' a handwoven Bondo-saree. Her aged body adorned with traditional noseplugs and bead necklaces symbolized the essence of Bondo life heading onto its eternal journey.

Bhima led a procession to the community's ancestral cremation ground situated on the tranquil hilltop. The village men played their 'suring,' a wind instrument, and the tribe moved rhythmically, embodying their ethos that even in sorrow, life's music plays on.

Upon reaching the sacred ground, Bhima, with the support of his clansfolk, constructed a pyre from the sacred Saja tree's logs. The air filled with a hush as he lit the pyre. The flames danced in a cosmic rhythm, liberating Meena's soul from mortal harness.

The mourning period followed, lasting for eight days where the tribesfolk abstained from their daily chores. It was a time of immense cohesion, where the villagers supported each other and shared their grief.

On the ninth day, Bhima, along with the adolescents of the tribe, descended the hills to gather the feathers of wild birds. These feathers were deemed as symbolic gestures from their ancestors welcoming Meena to the otherworld. That evening, each feather was individually cast into the river, a serene ceremony known as 'Pinja Visarjan.' This practice aimed to aid Meena’s transition into the afterlife, guided by the ancestral spirits.

Meena’s departure was an end but also a testament to the transcendent folklore of the Bondo Tribe. In their solitude, they found unity, and in their loss, they discovered a profound acceptance of mortality's universal truth. The customs encapsulated their harmonious relationship with life and death, assisting them in navigating their shared grief while reinforcing their strong ties with nature."

Nila, an elderly member of the tribe known for her stories about the forest, passed away peacefully one crisp winter morning. Her only son, Saroj, was handed the responsibility to perform Nila's last rites in accordance with Kondha traditions. As a community that believes in the soul's eternal journey, the Kondhas have particular death rituals to ensure the peaceful passage of the spirit.

Nila’s stiffened body was gently cleansed, adorning her in the last earthly attire, a simple white cloth, signifying purity. The residence wore a barren look, the echoes of whispered condolences filled the minds and mixture of turmeric and water, and placed a pot or 'gharna' atop her head, signifying the release of the spirit from the body.

Saroj led the funeral procession, carrying Nila's body on a handmade bamboo bier. As part of the journey to the cremation ground, the procession circled their sacred landmark- a towering fig tree thrice, praying for Nila's soul's salvation.

A pyre was prepared of sacred woods of Peepal, Banyan, and Sandalwood, each known for their spiritual significance. As Saroj set the pyre ablaze, incantations were chanted, invoking their deities to guide Nila’s soul. The rising smoke suggested the spirit's release from the physical realm, embarking on its journey beyond life.

Post-cremation, the family returned home to observe a week-long mourning period, during which they abstained from cooking at home. Meals offered by relatives and other villagers were consumed, reasserting the communal solidarity.

After seven days, they organized a traditional feast known as ‘Ekodista’. Saroj invited all inhabitants of the hamlet to commemorate Nila's journey, remembering her through shared tales and profound memories around a communal fire.

Through the melancholy of Nila's death, the Kondha tribe expressed their inherent belief in the transience of life and the journey it embarks upon beyond the physical realm. It underscored the truth that death isn't an end, rather a passage into a new state of existence and consciousness.

Story18,"Title: The Voyage of the Soul: A Bhumia Ritual

Under the shadow of Odisha's opulent Eastern Ghats, in the verdant district of Koraput, an elderly Bhumia, Kedar, had completed his mortal journey. The simplicity and humility of the Bhumia tribe echoed in Kedar's life and eventually slipped into his death. 

Bearing the sorrow of his father's departure, Kedar's eldest son, Nanda, took on the responsibility of conducting the last rites according to the Bhumia customs. The mournful day started with the body's cleansing, provided by the women of the household. Bathed with sanctified river water and adorned in traditional attire, Kedar's body was arranged on a bamboo cot, his favorite book of folklore by his side.

Led by Nanda, the funeral procession solemnly progressed towards the sacred grove, adorned with wildflowers and ancient Sal trees. In the resonance of hushed prayers and weeping winds, Kedar was bid farewell from his earthly abode. His favourite hymn, acknowledging the circle of life and death, was sung gently, providing solace to the mourning souls.

Amidst the grove, a pyre was meticulously assembled with the wood of the Sal tree. With a heavy heart soaked in tears, Nanda lit the pyre. The spectral dance of the flames glowed underneath the twilight sky, consuming Kedar's earthly form, liberating his soul to continue its cosmic journey.

The following morning, Nanda returned to the grove to collect his father's ashes. In a serene Bhumia ritual known as ‘Asthi Sanchayan’, he later dispersed the ashes into the compassionate waves of the Kolab River. This was believed to initiate Kedar's return to the cosmic consciousness and symbolize the life-death-life cycle.

During the subsequent eleven days, the Bhumia tribe observed ‘Soiyari,’ a period of mourning and remembrance. A hallmark of this period was refraining from music, an evident contrast in a tribe renowned for its songs and tales.

At the end of ‘Soiyari,’ a feast named 'Dasgaatra Bhoj' was held. Nanda invited the whole village to partake in the feast. As they shared the meal, stories of Kedar's wisdom and kindness were recounted, enabling his memory’s preservation in the heart of the Bhumia community.

His young apprentice, Srikant, found himself shouldering the responsibility of performing the death rites according to the sacred Khond traditions, passed on to him by Kanha himself.

A silence fell over the village as Kanha's body was prepared for his last journey. Bathed with water drawn from the sacred tribal spring and dressed in his favorite triblal robe, his lifeless form was laid upon a wooden bier. His revered staff, symbol of his leadership and beating drum, were placed at his side as he was prepared for his final journey.

A solemn procession, led by Srikant, walked towards the burial ground. As per the Khond belief, cremation is reserved for those who pass away untimely, while peaceful death at an old age is honored with a burial. The path was strewn with marigold petals, and the air hummed with the poignant songs of the tribe, voicing their respect for Kanha and their faith in life after death.

A deep pit was dug under the oldest Bodhi tree in the sacred grove, the chosen spot for Kanha's burial. The body, facing the East towards the rising sun, was carefully laid into the pit. Srikant covered the pit with earth, and the tribe planted a sapling atop it, a symbolic gesture of life springing from death.

The tribe then retreated to their respective homes, mourning in silence for nine nights, a period they called ‘Dus Din Ka Sog’. During this time, they refrained from any celebration, their hearts heavy with grief but also imbued with acceptance of the cycle of life and death.

On the tenth day, ‘Dashwa,’ Srikant led a grand ceremony. A feast was arranged, and the entire tribe gathered to share their memories of Kanha. Stories sung and meals shared acted as both a memorial and a comforting balm, making their loss a collective one, thus easing the rip of departure.

Kanha's departure marked a transition, but it was also a testament to the tribe's belief in life's cyclicity. The rites of the Khond tribe reiterated that death, while a goodbye to the physical world, opened a gateway to a spiritual journey, reminding them of the intertwining relationship of life, death, and resurrection beyond mortality."

Hidden in the depths of Malkangiri, Odisha, resides the Kamar tribe, a community known for their exquisite wood craftsmanship. When their oldest craftsman, Kamala, breathed his last, the tribe found themselves navigating the labyrinth of grief guided by their ancestral customs.

Kamaal’s son, Santosh, stepped up to uphold the responsibility of performing the death rites as per the Kamar traditions.

Story31,"Title: The Final Note – A Death Ritual of the Dom Community

In the bustling city of Bhubaneswar, the Dom community, primarily musicians and artists, add a vibrant musical harmony to the urban chorus. However, the peace was disrupted when their cherished Sarangi player, Harihar, breathed his last. His death left the community in a melancholy quiet, confronted with the silence of his absent melodies.

Tasked with conducting the death rites, Harihar's apprentice and grandson, Jagannath, performed his duties with a heavy heart. The tribe women bathed Harihar's body with water and tulsi leaves, deemed purifying in their customs. Adorned in white clothes, his much-loved Sarangi placed by his side, Harihar was prepared for his final performance.

The community gathered, their faces marked with grief, and together they took Harihar on his last journey. The sorrow-filled procession made its way to the banks of the Daya River, the rhythmic beats of the Mridangam softly resonating in the morning air, almost as if trying to fill the void left by Harihar's tunes.

Close to the river, a pyre was formed from the wood of the sacred Bel tree. Jagannath was given the responsibility to light the pyre. As the flames ignited, the sound of the community's collective chant filled the surrounds, a musical appeal to the divine to guide Harihar's spirit towards tranquillity.

The tribe then retreated, observing a period of seven days of mourning or 'Jagara Jaagiba.' During this period, a lamp was kept lit in Harihar's house, and prayers were conducted daily at dusk.

On the eighth day, known as 'Asthi Sanyojan,' Jagannath collected Harihar’s ashes from the pyre. Offerings were made in the name of Harihar, and his ashes were reverently released into the Daya River, marking his return to nature's eternal flow.

The final death rite, 'Shradh,' was held on the twelfth day. A ritualistic feast prepared by Harihar’s family was shared within the community, and the mourning period was brought to a close. As they bid farewell to Harihar's spirit, his music came alive, a shared reminiscence of their friend, teacher, and a gifted musician.

The power of music and the faith in the divine intermingles in the Dom community’s death rituals. Harihar’s death, while casting a shadow of sorrow, also shed light on the transitional course from mortality to the spiritual realm, an affirmation of continuity, and a final note in the symphony of life."

Deep within the untouched forests of Rayagada, Odisha, the Saura tribe finds its home. Their cyclical dance of life and death holds a unique cadence, one that came alive when their esteemed painter, Padmanabh, slipped into the quiet sleep of death.

His only daughter, Anupama, undertook the challenging voyage of organizing her father's final rites as per the Saura customs. The process began with Padmanabh's peaceful body being bathed in the holy stream that flows through their village, and then dressed in traditional attire, his painter's brush cradled next to him.

The tribal community, draped in their distinctive black and red attire, joined Anupama to say their goodbyes. Lifting Padmanabh on a bier made from bamboo, the community began the journey to the location of their ancestral ""Smashaan,"" situated high in the hills.

Reaching the sacred ground, a pyre was carefully assembled with logs from the sacred Bija tree. Anupama, along with the other villagers, began to prepare for the 'Agni Gaman,' the tribe's ancient fire ceremony. As the sun began bowing out, Anupama lit the pyre. The flames were seen by the community as a spiritual vehicle, carrying Padmanabh's soul to the ancestral realm.

For the subsequent three days, Anupama went to live in a primitive hut near the pyre, reciting holy incantations to aid Padmanabh's soul in its celestial journey.

On the fourth day, titled 'Pinda Dana,' Anupama prepared a feast using her father's favorite dishes which were then served to the crows. This ritual was considered as a form of ancestor worship.

At dusk, the entire village gathered near the aged Peepal tree to celebrate 'Trutiya Sraddha,' marking an end to the mourning. Stories of Padmanabh's works were narrated while his paintings were displayed around the communal fire, making the night less about grief and more about honoring the life he lived.

Amidst the fertile hills of Dhenkanal, Odisha, resides the Gouda tribe, known for their pastoral lifestyle and close-knit community. Their harmony was shaken when Dayanidhi, an admired tribal elder and legendary horse rider, passed away peacefully, leaving the tribe mourning his demise in profound grief.

The duty to conduct the sacred rites fell upon Dayanidhi’s youngest but dutiful daughter, Manorama. As per Gouda tradition, the body was cleansed with water and adorned with a traditional 'Dhoti,' depicting respect to the departed soul. Dayanidhi's horse saddle and whip were placed by his side; his lifeless body, lying solemn on a 'Pindha,' a ceremonial bamboo stretcher, resembled a restful warrior after a fierce battle.

Women of the tribe wailed the mournful tunes, their voices painting the tranquil morning air with hues of melancholy.

The tribe, their hearts heavy with loss, gathered at the cremation ground. Manorama with other villagers diligently assembled the funeral pyre, using the sacred wood from the Mahua and Banyan trees.

In the idyllic village of Sonepur, Odisha, known for its exquisite handloom crafts, the Tanti community weaves enchanting tales of life and death on their looms. The usually vibrant soundscape of bustling looms and chattering weavers faltered as their eldest weaver, Basudev, breathed his last. 

As the news of Basudev's death spread, the looms fell silent, and a somber mood enveloped the community.

The Tanti custom of weaving colored threads into beautiful patterns was reflected in their approach to death too - life (white thread) and death (black thread) intertwined to create a holistic picture of existence. Even in their grief, the Tantis found unity, acceptance, and comfort in lifelong beliefs and practices that kept their community fabric tightly knit. Basudev's spirit continued to live in the rhythmic clatter of their looms, forever a part of the Tanti's ceaseless weave of life."

The bond they shared was unfathomable until Ravi's sudden death sent shockwaves through the village, leaving Ganesh notably disturbed. 

While Ravi belonged to the Maharana caste, his unique bond with animals, especially elephants, placed him in high regard in the community. When he passed away, it wasn't just a human death in the village; it was a loss deeply felt in the animal realm too.

As customary in the Dangaria Kandha tribe, the duty of carrying out the death rites fell on Sita, Jagannath's eldest daughter. Backed by her courage and tribal traditions, she began the solemn ceremonies with Jagannath's body being prepared for its final journey. Bathed in water mixed with neem and turmeric, he was dressed in traditional tribal wear, his satchel of medicinal herbs nestled next to him.

Nestled in the serene landscapes of Sambalpur, Odisha is the community of the Kumbhars, known for their exquisite work with clay. Their mutable lives, shifting between creation and destruction, strongly reflected when their highly regarded potter, Mangal, succumbed to old age. 

The responsibility of performing the last rites as per the Kumbhar customs fell on Mangal's grandson, Shiv. The rituals began by cleansing Mangal's frail body with water using a clay pot his hands once modeled. Mangal was then gracefully dressed in a hand-woven dhoti, with his cherished pottery tools laid by his side as a cherished symbol of his lifelong craftsmanship. 

As dawn broke, Shiv ushered the mournful procession towards the sacred outskirts of the village, their traditional cremation ground. The waning moon observed from afar and the villagers paced rhythmically, their hearts heavy yet accepting.

Under the centenary Banyan tree, the pyre was prepared using Banyan tree logs. With the village men in silent condolences, Shiv lit the pyre. The air pulsated with chants of ‘Amritambu,’ a prayer asking the cosmos for the peaceful ascension of Mangal's soul.

The village observed twelve days of mourning, 'Sutak,' during which Shiv maintained an oil lamp near Mangal's remaining embers, offering silent prayers, his dutiful tribute to his revered grandfather.

The thirteenth day, 'Karaghar,' marked the end of the mourning period. It began with Shiv collecting the embers left from Mangal's pyre, dispersing them into the nearby water stream, symbolizing the return of elements to nature. Shiv prepared an earthen pot for the tribal feast, 'Bhandara' using the clay from the river bank where Mangal taught him his first pottery lessons. It was then filled with fruits and distributed among the villagers.

As they feasted, memories of Mangal echoed around the fire: his laughter, fragments of his wisdom, and tales of his noble spirit, transmuting grief into a celebration of a life thoroughly lived.

In times of deep sorrow, the Kumbhar tribe found unity, and their rituals brought them closer. The customs clung to their core belief of the cyclical nature of life, death, and life beyond death. They offered closure and healing to the grieving hearts, a testament that while Mangal’s mortal form returned to the earth, his essence will forever live in the clay structures that shape their homes and hearts."

Tucked away in the inaccessible hills of Malkangiri, Odisha, thrives the Bonda tribe, one of India's oldest and most isolated tribes. When the revered tribal chieftain, Raghunath, breathed his last, the tranquil hill tribe was immersed in collective mourning.

His youngest, Parvati, following the tribe’s matrilineal traditions, shouldered the responsibility to carry out the death ritual. Raghunath's deceased body was bathed in the holy Duduma waterfall and clad in a traditional 'ganga' (loincloth). His much-used 'lal phi', a handcrafted brass pipe, was set beside him to accompany his journey to the other realm.

Under the pallid moonlight, Parvati directed a hushed funeral march to the chieftain's hill, a resting place for their past warriors. Singing ancient mourning songs, the tribe presented a heart-rending spectacle as they helped transport their beloved chieftain, their voices harmoniously begging for a peaceful transition.

On reaching the designated site, a grave was dug, and Raghunath's body was carefully lowered into it. He was covered with soil, then with stones to denote his chieftain status, symbolizing his everlasting link to the celestial mountains.

Subsequently, the tribe observed a seclusion period known as 'jach,' refraining from their everyday activities like hunting and fishing. During this time, Parvati maintained a vigil near her father's grave, her prayers and chants inviting their mountain deities to guide her father to eternal rest.

The seclusion ended with a feast 'Balya Bhog' on the seventh day. Prepared in honor of the departed chieftain, a large boar was hunted and cooked by the men in their traditional bamboo cooking method. The tribe gathered in the communal hut, their laughter, and tales of Raghunath's leadership echoing in the hills, transforming their mourning into an appreciation of his life and legacy.

Despite the sorrow of Raghunath's demise, the Bonda tribe found unity in their customs. Their death rituals reflected their steadfast belief in the advanced life-death-rebirth cycle and their deep ties with their ancestral mountains. The commemoration of the life lived served as a profound reminder that their spirits, just like the mighty hills around them, stand resolute against the passage of time."

Nestled in the verdant hills of the Niyamgiri range in Odisha, the Kondh tribe live in symbiosis with the abundant nature surrounding them. Recently, they found themselves awash with sorrow upon the demise of their revered shaman, Mitu.

As per their tradition, Mitu's youngest son, Biju, assumed the responsibility of performing the death rites. Biju bathed his father's body in the holy Bissam Cuttack river, then dressed him in traditional garb—a hand-woven loincloth ornamented with sacred tribal motifs. Mitu’s ceremonial staff—a symbol of his revered status—and his feathered headdress were placed by his side, preparing him for his journey into the afterlife.

As the first hues of dawn began to paint the sky, Biju led the grief-choked procession to the sacred grove, the 'Dharambagh.' The whisper of the wind, rustle of the leaves, and the mournful beats of the 'dhemsa' echoed their shared sorrow.

In the heart of the grove stood a majestic peepal tree, beneath which they dug a burial pit. Biju gently lowered his father's body into the pit, the tribe watching in solemn silence as they returned the shaman to his beloved nature. 

Over the following days, the tribe practiced 'Sani Raij,' a week-long mourning period. During this time, Biju stayed in seclusion in the Dharambagh, fasting and praying for guidance for Mitu's soul.

On the eight day, a feast known as 'Sanja Hadia' was arranged. The village came together to partake the meal prepared from the seasonal produce, reflecting upon Mitu's teachings. As the tribal 'jhumar' music filled the air, the young performed the 'ghoomar' dance, a tribute to Mitu, turning the community's sorrow into a celebration of his life and wisdom.

Mitu's death brought about an understated transformation within Kondh tribal life. Their death rituals underscored their deep respect for nature and belief in the continuity of the spirit.

In the undulating hills of Rayagada, Odisha, the Lanjia Saora Tribe, famed for their intricate wall murals, resides in a tranquil harmony with nature. The peaceful routine was disrupted when their oldest 'Bhagat,' or healer, Kishori, succumbed to age.

Honoring their customs, Kishori's granddaughter, Madhuri, undertook the duty of orchestrating the death rites. The elderly woman's body was carefully bathed in the Patajhari stream, then adorned in a traditional 'pachra' sari. To symbolize her role as a healer, Kishori was laid to rest clutching a bunch of medicinal herbs, a poignant homage to her life's work.

At sunrise, Madhuri guided the mourning tribe towards their sacred forest clearing or 'Sarna'. The wailing mixed with the melodic notes of their traditional instrument, 'Tudum,' creating a haunting symphony echoing their shared grief.

In the heart of the Sarna, sheltered by a towering Mahua tree, they dug a grave. Kishori's body was gently laid within, and the tribe bid adieu to their beloved Bhagat as they covered her physical form with earth - a fitting return to nature.

The tribe then committed to a period of mourning called 'Asara', refraining from farming and fishing for twenty-one days. Madhuri spent these days in solitary prayer near the grave, calling on the ancestral spirits to guide her grandmother to the otherworldly realm.

Upon the completion of Asara, the tribe organized a feast, 'Nua Khai,' marking the end of their mourning period. Madhuri prepared a traditional dish of fish and rice, serving it on sal leaves, a nostalgic reminder of Kishori's humble origins and culinary preferences. As they savored the meal, stories flowed, memories stirred, and their grief transformed into admiration of the healer's life and wisdom.

The death of Kishori served as a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of life. Yet, the Lanjia Saora's death rituals reflected an abiding respect for nature and honoring of their ancestors' spirits. Their ceremonials mirrored the shared understanding that Kishori, in death, had merely transformed form – from the healer amongst them to the guiding spirit watching over them from the celestial world.

A twelve-day mourning period ensued, called the ‘Teus Sarna’, a time when regular activities were paused in honor of the departed soul. Every day Maya, along with other women, sang traditional Santhal mourning songs, also known as 'Dasae Geet', around the still warm ashes. The songs told tales of Padma’s wisdom and kindness, echoing her spirit across the landscapes.

Story31,"Title: Homecoming of the Seafarer: A Ritual from the Bengali Fishermen Community

In the tranquil coastal hamlet of Paradip, Odisha, the Bengali Fishermen Community leads a life governed by the ebb and flow of the sea. The lull of the ocean rhythm was disturbed when their seasoned fisherman, Keshav, drowned during a turbulent storm, casting a deep void in their close-knit fraternity.

Reflecting their community custom, the responsibility of carrying out Keshav's last rites fell on his younger brother, Subhas. As dictated by tradition, Keshav's body was bathed in the Bay of Bengal's salty waters. He was then dressed in a simple white dhoti, and a small fishing net was placed in his cold hands, paying homage to his lifelong bond with the sea.

At dawn, Subhas led the community towards their sacred cremation site by the beach, the 'Maha Samudra'. The entire village followed, their path illuminated by the soft glow of the rising sun, mourning the loss of their fellow seafarer.

On the sandy stretch of Maha Samudra, a pyre made of driftwood was assembled. Subhas lit the pyre just as the first sunrays hit the sea, the crackling fire shooting sparks into the salty air, symbolising Keshav's transition from the material to the spiritual realm.

Following the funeral, the community observed a mourning period, known as 'Sutak', for thirteen days. During this time, Subhas refrained from venturing out to sea, spending his days near the cremation spot offering prayers for the safe passage of Keshav's soul.

On the fourteenth day, to bid a final farewell and mark the end of Sutak, a communal feast known as 'Shraaddha' was held. Subhas prepared Keshav's favorite 'Illish maach' and rice, which was then served to the community. As they shared the meal, tales of Keshav's courage, wit, and unforgettable sea exploits were shared, gradually transforming their sorrow into a tribute, celebrating the seafarer's well-lived life.

Keshav's untimely departure was a tragic reminder of life's unpredictability. Yet, the funeral rituals reflected their communal acceptance of death as an inevitable journey every seafaringmate must undertake, trusting the sea to guide their departed to calmer spiritual shores. Keshav would no longer navigate the sea with them, but his spirit, much like the murmuring ocean's waves, would continue to echo within their hearts and tales retold of a brave seafarer."

Their serene existence was punctuated by a profound silence when their elder shepherd, Lambodar, passed away, leaving a void filled with unsung shepherd’s songs.

In keeping with the Gauda's rituals, Lambodar's eldest son, Kedar, undertook the duty of performing the death rites. With loving care, Kedar washed his father's lifeless body in the serene waters of Brahmani River, then clad his father in the traditional handwoven 'gamsa.' Lambodar's shepherd’s flute was carefully placed beside him, symbolizing his lifelong vocation.

At the break of day, Kedar led the funeral procession towards the sacred grove - 'Jahera' - the community's final resting place. The echo of the mourning 'dholak' drum cast a somber ambiance over the village, reflecting their shared grief.

Upon reaching Jahera, beneath the shade of the ancient fig tree, Kedar ignited the funeral pyre. As the flames rose, so did the prayers of the tribe, seeking divine guidance for Lambodar's soul to navigate the celestial pastures.

Following this, the tribe observed 'Sradha Sandhya,' a fifteen-day mourning period. During this period, Kedar spent his days by the Brahmani River, praying for his father's pastoral transition to the otherworldly realm.

Yet, through their death rituals, the Gauda tribe found unity in their shared sorrow and reaffirmed their faith in life’s eternal journey beyond death. Although Lambodar was no longer among them, the melodies from his flute and lessons from his life continue to shepherd the tribe, just like the gentle lead of the shepherd’s star in the night sky."

In the ancient city of Puri, Odisha, the Rathakara tribe, renowned artisans constructing majestic chariots, lead a simplistic, harmonious existence. But the tide of tranquillity ebbed away with the demise of their master craftsman, Bishwakarma, veiling the community under a cloak of shared grief.

As per the Rathakara ritual, Bishwakarma's son, Sudarshan, was bestowed with the responsibility to perform the last rites. Following the age-old traditions, Sudarshan norished his father's body in the holy Gundicha river, dressed him in a white fabric of 'khandua', embellished with traditional Odia verses. In tribute to his father’s lifelong craftsmanship, his most cherished chisel was placed next to him.

With the rising sun peeking over the horizon, Sudarshan commenced the funeral procession towards ‘Rathakhala', the workshop where Bishwakarma breathed life into countless wooden blocks, transforming them into celestial chariots. The mournful rhythm of the 'Mahuri', their traditional musical instrument, resonated with their sorrow, creating an aura of reverence.

At Rathakhala, Sudarshan prepared the pyre from the shavings of the sacred Neem wood, the same wood Bishwakarma used to construct the chariots. Sudarshan lit the pyre, the crackling flames reaching into the clear-blue sky, symbolizing Bishwakarma’s soul’s journey towards the heavens.

In the days that followed, the tribe observed 'Ashrama', a mourning period of thirteen days. During these days, Sudarshan refrained from his work and spent hours next to the now cold pyre, praying and seeking ancestral guidance for his father’s peaceful ascension.

On the fourteenth day, a communal feast, 'Prasna,' marked the conclusion of the Ashrama. Sudarshan prepared Bishwakarma’s favorite dish, 'Dalma', and served it to the community. Shared laughter, tales of Bishwakarma’s incredible craftsmanship, and nostalgic reminiscing turned their grief into a celebration of their master artisan’s life, transforming the workshop into a memorial of respect and fond memories. 

The passing away of Bishwakarma was a poignant reminder of life’s temporality. However, the tribe's rituals reflected their deep-seated faith in the continuity of life beyond the physicality of existence.

The soulful beats of their dance drama turned into a quiet rhythm of mourning.

Following Kela customs, Hari's son, Ravi, was entrusted with the task of performing the last rites. As part of their unique rituals, Ravi bathed his father's body in the calming waters of Lake Chilika, and dressed him in the flamboyant attire of Narasingha Avatar - the character Hari used to enact. His 'Mardala', a percussion instrument Hari played, was kept by his side.

A cloud of somber silence swept over their otherwise rhythmic lives when their revered blacksmith, Udayan, returned to the cosmic forge, his physical presence extinguished like the flames of his forge.

In accordance with Bhottada customs, Udayan’s grandson, Arpan, took up the responsibility of performing the last rites. To prepare Udayan's body for the journey, Arpan washed his body in the sacred river Ib, then dressed him in the tribe's conventional attire, a hand-stitched dhoti-kurta. His cherished blacksmith tools were placed alongside him, representing his life's calling.

At dawn's break, Arpan began the funeral procession towards their recognized cremation ground, 'Devta Badi'. The vibrant beat of their traditional drum, the 'Dola', mirrored the tribe's shared sorrow, a stark contrast to its usual celebratory rhythm.

Arriving at Devta Badi, under the protective branch of an old Sal tree, Arpan prepared a pyre with logs of the same sacred tree. As Arpan lit the pyre, the rising embers coupled with the collective chants of the tribe carried Udayan's spirit towards the celestial forge, bidding him a revered farewell.

Post the cremation, the tribe observed 'Samaya', an eight-day mourning period. Arpan maintained steps of respect by avoiding work and spent his days by the gradually fading pyre, praying for the smooth transition of Udayan's spirit into the divine realm.

Memories of Udayan's master craftsmanship, his relentless dedication, and the heartwarming warmth of his forge were shared, slowly turning their collective sorrow into a vibrant celebration of a life well-lived.

Even though Udayan's journey brought them face-to-face with mortality, the Bhottada tribe's funeral rituals exalted the notion of life as a cycle of birth, existence, and merging back into the cosmic forge. Though Udayan was no longer physically present, the sparks of his forge lived on in his creations, in the skills passed down to Arpan, and echoed in their tribal lore, a fearlessly hammered reminder of a life well-lived.

Adhering to the Bhumia customs, Jagatram's granddaughter, Aditi, undertook the responsibility of conducting her grandfather's last rites. The village women prepared Jagatram's body, washing it in the holy waters of River Kolab, and adorning him in the traditional attire, a simple hand-woven dhoti.

Even in death, Bansi's departure struck a poignant chord in the heart of the Ollar music.

As the first light of dawn touched the earth, Mandar led the funeral procession towards the tribe's sacred astronomical platform, 'Khagolpadma.' The procession moved slowly, silent but for the haunting tunes of the ancestral instrument, 'Madol,' their rhythm reflecting the tribe’s shared hardship.

At 'Khagolpadma,' under the gaze of a centuries-old Banyan tree, a pyre was carefully prepared. As Mandar set the pyre aflame, the tribe united in their prayers and hymns, guiding Jatila's spirit on its path to the divine cosmos.

In the days that followed, the Gadaba tribe observed a mourning period called 'Astro-Shradha,' which lasted thirteen nights, one for each lunar cycle. During this time, Mandar spent his nights under the open sky, silently paying homage to his grandfather's spirit among the ethereal glow of the cosmos.

On the fourteenth day, the tribe convened to celebrate 'Brahma-Bhoj,' a feast to mark the end of mourning. Mandar prepared Jatila's favorite ‘Macha Poda,’ a traditional fish dish, which was then shared among the tribe. As they ate under the starlit sky, stories of Jatila’s celestial wisdom, his accurate predictions, and tales he wove around the constellations gradually turned the plangent air into a gentle celebration of a life lived under the guidance of the cosmos.

Though Jatila’s death reminded them of life’s inevitable end, their rituals underlined a deep-rooted belief in the continuity of their spiritual journey. While his physical form had returned to the earth, Jatila’s knowledge lived on within the tribe. His spirit continued to guide them through their cosmic observations, enriching their celestial sojourn and interweaving his wisdom into the narratives woven under the nightly dome of the Gadaba tribe.

Nestled in the mystical terrains of Kalahandi, Odisha, is the tribe of Ghumura, folk dancers known for their rhythmic performances that reverberate with life's tempo. Their harmonious existence, however, was rifted when their lead dancer, Damru, took his last bow, leaving behind an echoing silence in their music.

In line with Ghumura's unique rituals, Damru's son, Tara, shouldered the sacred responsibility of conducting his father's last rites. After bathing Damru's body in the local Tel River, Tara adorned him in the traditional attire of a bright red dhoti. Damru's beloved 'Ghumura' - a terracotta drum, was rested beside him, symbolizing his eternal bond with dance and music.

At dawn, Tara led a somber funeral procession towards their ancestral cremation ground, 'Nrutya Akhra.' The normally vibrant air turned solemn as the mournful beats of the collective 'Ghumuras' reverberated with their mutual sorrow.

Upon reaching Nrutya Akhra, under the evergreen shade of a Mahuli tree, Tara lit the funeral pyre. The flames sparkled, reflecting the artistry of Damru's life and symbolizing the release of his spirit from the confines of the corporeal world.

The tribe then observed 'Amasha,' a twelve-day mourning period. Tara refrained from dancing during this time, spending his day in quiet contemplation by the dwindling flames of Damru's pyre, praying for his father's joyous dance into the afterlife.

On the thirteenth day, to mark the completion of 'Amasha,' the tribe hosted the 'Nrutya Prasad,' a feast symbolizing an end to their mourning. Tara prepared a meal of ‘Kangu hando,’ Damru's favorite dish made of foxtail millet, which was shared amongst the dancers. As they relished the traditional meal, stories about Damru’s mesmerizing performances and his unrivaled rhythm were shared, transforming the energy of their shared sorrow into a celebration of the life and artistry of their lead dancer.

The plot of Damru’s departure introduced life's impermanence starkly into their rhythm-filled existence. Yet, the death rituals of Ghumura held an inherent philosophy of the unending rhythm of life, of birth and rebirth, mimicked in the loops of their dance routines. As the tribe danced again under the Mahuli tree, it was not hard to imagine Damru’s spirit, eternally present in their drum beats, gracefully dancing to their rhythm, an immortal inspiration."

Nestled within the dense forestry of Mayurbhanj, Odisha, the Hill Kharia tribe upholds a unique bond with the Kadamba trees, the source of their sustenance. Their peaceful harmony with the nature was disrupted when their oldest Kadamba harvester, Jeevan, returned to the eternal abode, leaving behind a stark void within the tribal circle.

In accordance with the Hill Kharia customs, the responsibility of conducting Jeevan's last rites fell on his son, Bhuvan. As decreed by their customs, Bhuvan bathed his father's lifeless body in the sacred Budhabalanga river, donned him in a traditional white 'Dhoti,' and placed his cherished Kadamba harvesting tools alongside him.

With the first light of dawn, Bhuvan guided the procession from their village towards their sacred cremation ground, 'Moksha Kshetra'. The grief-filled silence was punctuated by the somber strums of their tribal instrument, 'Dhodro banam,' reflecting the tribe's shared sorrow.

At 'Moksha Kshetra,' under the comforting shade of an ancient Kadamba tree, the sacred funeral pyre was prepared. As Bhuvan lit the pyre, the prayers of the villagers rose with the smoke, guiding Jeevan's spirit on its expedition to the heavens.

The tribe then observed 'Sad Purti,' a sixteen-day mourning period. During this time, Bhuvan refrained from Kadamba harvesting, his time instead spent in prayers for his father's soul and its peaceful journey to the celestial Kadamba orchard.

On the seventeenth day, to honor Jeevan and mark the end of mourning, Bhuvan organized a grand feast known as 'Bandapani.' He prepared a traditional meal of 'Muga Pitha,' a sweet delicacy made from moong lentils which was his father's favorite, and served it to the tribe. As the feast unfolded, tales of Jeevan's skill, wisdom, and his profound connection with the Kadamba were passed around, their collective sorrow gradually transforming into a celebration of a life lived in harmony with nature.

Jeevan's departure was a stark reminder of life's temporality, but the Hill Kharia tribe's death customs highlighted their unwavering belief in afterlife and their spiritual connection with the Kadamba. Although Jeevan was no longer among them, each blossom they harvested from the Kadamba and each story recalled about him ensured that his essence became an eternal part of the Hill Kharia tribe, guiding them as firmly as the roots of their beloved Kadamba trees."

Surrounded by the majestic Niyamagiri Hills in Odisha, the Dangaria Kondh tribe leads an unhurried and humble existence, their livelihood rhythmically aligned with agriculture and animal husbandry. Their tranquil day-to-day life lamentably halted when their seasoned shepherd, Dharma, peacefully passed on, casting a solemn shadow over their vibrant community connection.

Honoring their tribal customs, Dharma's son, Nanda, undertook the solemn task of performing his father's death rites. As part of the ritual, he bathed his father's still body in the holy waters of the Nagavali River and dressed him in the traditional white 'dhoti'. To signify Dharma's occupation, his shepherding staff and a small tuft of sheep’s wool were placed next to him.

As the group of stars known as the Seven Sages began to dim in the morning sky, Nanda led the funeral procession towards the sacred burial ground, named 'Pinda Dham'. The gathering walked in silence, their sorrow resonating in the gentle jingling of the sheep's bells, paying a heartfelt tribute to their departed shepherd.

At Pinda Dham, Nanda dug a grave at the foot of the ancient Panasa tree, a site that had seen many such somber occasions. Dharma's body was gently lowered into the resting earth, marking his transition from a shepherd among his flock to an ancestor amidst the stars.

After the burial, the tribe embarked on 'Pindatraya,' a mourning period of three days. During this time, Nanda refrained from shepherding and spent his hours by the Panasa tree, praying for the smooth ascension of Dharma's spirit.

On the fourth day, to mark the end of the mourning period, the tribe held 'Pranipaat,' a sacred feast. Nanda cooked a meal of lamb meat and millet, his father's favorite dish. As they shared the meal, stories of Dharma's wisdom, his caring nature, and his famed skills as a shepherd were shared, gradually transforming their shared sorrow into a celebration of his life.

In the midst of their grief, the Dangaria Kondh tribe found unity in their customs. Their death ceremonies embraced the cyclic nature of existence, transforming from mourning to rejoicing in memory of a life well-lived. As they returned to their daily routines, the tribe carried Dharma's spirit with them; his wisdom echoed in their shepherding calls, his warmth residing in each tuft of wool, forever a part of their loving community."

In the untouched haven of Rayagada, Odisha, the Saora tribe has meticulously preserved its cultural wealth of traditional music. Their harmonious living was silenced when their revered musician, Kanha, succumbed to an illness, resonating a profound grief across their tribal harmony.

According to Saora rituals, Kanha's son, Bansi, was bestowed with the sacred duty of conducting his father’s death rites. Following their ancestral customs, Bansi bathed his father's lifeless body in the tranquil flowing waters of the Nagavali River, then clad him in their traditional white attire. To pay homage to Kanha's lifelong devotion to music, his cherished 'Dhunkel,' a traditional Saora musical instrument, was placed alongside him.

In the low light of dawn, Bansi began the funeral procession towards their sacred ground, 'Mahasthan,' the resting place of their ancestors. The grief-stricken tribe followed him in respectful silence, their path marked only by the poignant resonance of the 'Madal,' mirroring their collective loss.

Upon reaching Mahasthan, an imposing Sal tree's sacred shadow marked the grateful burial site. As per their customs, Bansi excavated a grave and gently lowered Kanha into his final resting place, marking his transition from a celestial musician to an ancestral spirit. The grave was then filled with earth, completing his physical journey and integrating his soul with nature.

Subsequent to the burial was the 'Astachhap,' a period of mourning for eight days. Respecting their traditions, Bansi abstained from playing any musical instrument during this period, spending his days and nights in solemn prayers by his father's grave, his silence betraying his deep loss.

Towards the closure of Astachhap, the tribe held 'Manima Bhoji,' a grand feast signaling the end of mourning. Bansi cooked 'Kangu Khichdi,' a traditional millet dish that used to be Kanha’s favorite. As the tribe partook in the feast, tales of Kanha’s melodious renditions, his love for their tribal music, and his contribution to their artistic heritage filled the air, gradually transforming their sorrow into a grand harmony celebrating a life filled with melodious high notes.

Although Kanha's departure was a jarring chord in their symphony of life, the Saora Tribe's death rituals embraced death as a natural progression in the eternal cycle of life. As the tribe woke up next day to the tuneful silence, they knew that while Kanha may have ceased to be among them, his music, his rhythm, and his soulful notes would continue to echo in every corner of Mahasthan and within every beat of their hearts."
