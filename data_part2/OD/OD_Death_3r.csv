Story0,"Title: The Majestic End: A Tale of Departure in Odisha

Straddling the eastern coast of India lay the culturally enriched state of Odisha, resplendent with its people's deeply ingrained beliefs and traditions, each echoing engrossing tales of customs past. Among them, the unique death ritual, the 'Ekodishta', made a compelling narrative of an individual's final journey and the unique manner of commemoration.

As dawn broke over the small village of Kendrapara, the air was heavy with sorrow. The sweet-scented smoke from the sacred yajna filled the lanes, drawing mournful tears from the villagers, serving as a lamentable reminder- Madhu Babu, the village elder and a beacon of wisdom, had journeyed on to the divine realm.

According to the ancient Hindu tradition prevalent in Odisha, 'Ekodishta' was to be conducted on the 11th day post demise. Since Madhu Babu was the patriarch with no surviving kin, the duty fell upon the village, considered his extended family. The Sanford trained Purohit, a trusted figure in the community, took charge to oversee the sacraments.

As per the tradition, first in the predawn hours, a sacred bath, 'Nirajana', was performed at the riverbank, where Madhu Babu's mortal remains were earlier consigned to the holy water. The Purohit chanted vedic hymns, offering salutations to the departed soul while the devoted villagers took a holy dip, symbolizing their purification and preparation for the ritual.

Next, a straw effigy 'Pinda' symbolizing the departed soul was lovingly crafted and dressed in new clothes. The effigy sat surrounded by intricate drawings of anthropomorphic figures, known as 'Akhanda', depicting ancestors and deities alike. Signifying the ongoing presence of the departed soul among the living, it was treated with utmost respect.

The 'Nirajana' and 'Pinda-Akhanda' marked the completion of the primary rituals. Now, the village bustled in anticipation for the 'Mahaprasad', a community feast. An array of traditional Odia delicacies was prepared en masse, enough to feed the village thrice over. The joy of sharing food endorsing Madhu Babu's undying principle of community unity.

The feast was duly preceded by 'Bali-Vaishnava', or offerings to gods, anthropomorphized symbols and finally the crow, considered Yama's vahana. As the villagers reverently partook the Mahaprasad in palm leaf plates, laughter, and mirth slowly replaced the discontent of their loss.

As the day waned, the Purohit commenced the 'Jaya Anusti', chanting mantras for the departed soul's enlightenment and eternal peace. The villagers simultaneously recited the sacred texts, their voices rising to a symphony, a melodic goodbye to their departed village elder. The straw effigy, the Pinda was then gently placed on a bamboo raft adorned with flowers and a flaming clay lamp, set afloat on the river, symbolizing the soul's ethereal journey from mortality to eternity.

With the gradual disappearance of the flickering lamp light, the ritual concluded, leaving behind a sense of wholeness. Through 'Ekodishta', the villagers had not only solemnized Madhu Babu's departure but also celebrated his exemplary life, their communal unity, and ancient culture.

In the heart of Odisha, within the realms of these rituals, every end was a majestic beginning, every goodbye a different kind of hello, and every human life - departed or present - was, in its quintessential essence, an ongoing divine saga."
Story1,"Title: Song of the Dying Star: A Jagannath Tale from Odisha

In the radiant, ancient realms of Odisha, a unique death ceremony resonates with the powerful rhythm of faith and an undying sense of peace. Nestled in the bustling temple city of Puri, the mystical Jagannath Temple was home to a not-so-known ritual that marked the regal departure of the temple's royalty, the wooden deities of Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra, celebrated every twelve or nineteen years. It is the divine death ritual and reincarnation known as 'Nabakalebara.'

The tale unfolds with the passing of an unusually fiery summer, the year signaling the eminent death and reincarnation of the wooden deities. As the death of the existing deities approached, secretive emissaries initiated their quest for the divine tree, 'Daru-Brahma,' from which the new deities would be carved.

Chosen as per strict criteria, including specific markings, the trees' discovery was heralded by routines of severe antiquity. After a fortnight of prayer and preparation, known as the 'Banajaga Yatra,' the chosen tree was quietly felled, marking initiating the deities' death ceremony.

Simultaneously, in the grand Jagannath temple at Puri, the 'secret ritual' was at play. Under the cloak of the darkest night, veiled behind the temple’s resounding walls, the 'Brahmapadarth,' a mysterious life force of the deities, was transferred from the old to the new idols, carved from the 'Daru-Brahma.' This transfer, considered 'death in ritual' for the old deities, was conducted in private by the 'Daitapati' priests, the only custodians of the mystical 'Brahmapadarth.'

This marked the culmination of the old deities' cycle and the onset of a new one led by the new idols. The temple grounds now echoed a celebratory air, akin to a fresh beginning than an aftermath of death. Equipped with this divine energy, the deities were ready for their grand procession to the temple.

The old idols were then ritually buried within the Koili Vaikuntha area inside the temple, a unique burial tradition, aptly signifying the end of one cycle and the commencement of another. As dawn broke, the new deities replaced their older versions on the divine throne, and life resumed in Puri, carrying a touch of new divinity.

The 'Nabakalebara' vitalised the age-old belief in reincarnation - that death was simply a transitory phase, not an ending. As the old deities' wood turned into the earth, and the new ones took over, a seamless transition of divine energy unfolded, lakhs of devotees basking in the ethereal warmth of the divine transformation.

So dreamlike and surreal was this death ceremony, that the grand tales of a wooden God's death, reinvention, and subsequent rebirth continue to permeate throughout the lanes of Puri, and more broadly, within the deeply spiritual fabric of Odisha. In these tales, the very concept of death was re-envisioned, not as a definitive end but a stirring opening to a cycle of eternal divinity."
Story2,"Title: Sagar Mukti: The Final Release

In the riverine terrains of Odisha, where the river Mahanadi slithers through the land, life and death coexist in a seamless flow, echoing with the rhythmic lull of the water. Among the multitudes of rustic customs observed, the death ritual of 'Sagar Mukti', or the final release, stands out not just as a testament to the belief of life beyond death, but it also embodies a poignant homage to the departed souls.

This story revolves around a humble fisherman, Damodar Babu, from the small village of Sonepur. Adored by the community, his intricately crafted fishing nets and river lores made him a respected figure among them. So, when he breathed his last, leaving behind a legacy of tethered hearts and sun-kissed wisdom, the village stood united for his Sagar Mukti.

Sagar Mukti, as the tradition guided, alluded to the departed's last journey towards merging with the sacred water, symbolically uniting with the cosmic energy. Damodar Babu, having lived his life around the nurturing river, was respectfully placed on a bamboo bier, a 'Khatol', meticulously adorned with parijat flowers and while observing the 'Raksha Bidhaan', a sacred thread was tied around the deceased's waist symbolising protection in the heavenly abyss.

Soon, an entourage of mourning villagers, chanting mournful verses, tuned to the beats of 'Mahabali' a traditional folk drum, reverberating through the tranquil expanse, guided Damodar Babu's last earthly voyage towards the riverbank. At the banks, as the evening sun painted a soothing hue, and swirling water pulsed with departing daylight, the Khatol was set afloat on the river, its departure coinciding with the setting sun.

As the villagers watched the floating bier meander away, a stunning spectacle of 'Diya-Arpan', or the offering of lamps followed. Each villager gently released an earthen lamp set on a peepal leaf onto the river. As the illuminated river mirrored the evening sky, the villagers profoundly believed that each flicker guided Damodar Babu's soul towards celestial freedom.

The resonating sounds of the 'Mahabali', symbolic parijat flowers, and the emotions elicited by the flickering earthen lamps, all cultivated an ethereal endeavor that transformed the harsh reality of death into a celestial farewell. 

It was a glow that not just signified the village's tribute to Damodar Babu, but also reflected the unique tradition of Sagar Mukti - an eloquently sculpted epitome of eternal release. The veil of death was then transmuted into a vessel of light, drifting peacefully alongside the calming rhythm of the river, a crystal reminder of the harmonious coexistence of life and death in the humble hamlets of Odisha."
Story3,"Title: The Footprint Farewell: An Odisha Tradition 

In the picturesque landscapes of the tribal heartland of Odisha, traditions rhythmically blend with the natural surroundings, painting the earth and sky with untold stories. This story is about Narayan, a potter from the colourful Kondh tribe from Phulbani district, and the tribe's unique death ritual, 'Padadana', or giving footprint that marked the poignant voyage of the departed.

Narayan, with the clay's delightful crackle on his weathered fingertips, was the source of the tribe's magnificent clay pots. He spent his days sculpting earthen stories in harmony with nature. The old potter, having lived a creative and vibrant life, one sunlit morning quietly departed, leaving the tribe in sadness.

As per their tribal customs, Narayan's death ceremony was not just a ritual, but an artistically poignant farewell. The tribe's traditions blended the sacred with the earthly, creating a profound experience. 'Padadana', or the footprint giving, was the heart of this melancholy ceremony.

Immediately after his passing, the tribal priest, or 'Jani', covered Narayan's bare feet with red ochre, a hued earth pigment, ceremonially preparing him for the spiritual journey. Near Narayan's cherished clay-pit, a smooth patch of damp clay was prepared. In it, Narayan's ochre-painted feet were gently pressed, capturing a lasting impression. The footprint, a symbolic farewell, represented Narayan's departure with an endearing, earthly signature.

Next, the clay patch with the footprint was carefully excavated, and placed beside the burning pyre. The tribe believed that Narayan's spirit resided in the impression, kindling the celestial journey towards the presented fire's purifying warmth. Post-cremation, Narayan's ashes, mixed with the charred footprint clay, were consigned into the forest, facilitating his alliance with Mother Earth. 

The process of the 'Padadana', from the careful preparation of clay footprints to their final immersion, gently eased the tribe members into the conclusive farewell. It wasn't just a mourning, but also a mellow celebration of Narayan's lived journey, made understandable through their earth-hued lenses.

These footprints on clay, ignited, immersed and returned to nature, mirrored the journey of human life in the grand scheme. It presented a poignant parallel where birth came from the earth, lived in constant communion with it, and eventually succumbed into the motherly embrace of the very soil.

Years after Narayan's last journey, the Kondh tribe fondly remembered him through the footprint tales whispered among the clay mounds. In the 'Padadana's echo, they found a potter's love for the craft, his earthly pathways, and Odisha's tribal essence, an eternal testament of their eternal bond with Mother Earth."
Story4,"Title: The Ancestor’s Feast: A Tribal Ritual in Odisha

In the verdant foothills of the Niyamgiri Mountains in Odisha, steeped in tradition and lore, the tribal community of the Dongria Kondhs, has adopted a unique death ritual woven into the fabric of their everyday life. Central to these ceremonies is the lesser-known ritual called 'Kalu Panda' - a celebration of death in the form of a feast, as a mark of respect for their departed ancestors.

The protagonist of this story is Lachhman, the elderly Jamadar or the village head of a small Dongria Kondh settlement. Known and respected for his wisdom and leadership, Lachhman’s demise signified not just the departure of a leader but the passing of a guiding star, and the 'Kalu Panda' was deemed suitable to honour his journey onwards.

As dusk draped itself over the hamlet, the mournful silence was permeated by whispers of 'Kalu Panda', initiating the preparations. Ingredients were gathered; the tribal men collected the finest wild honey while the women prepared hand-ground jaggery and flour from locally grown finger millets. 

On the eleventh day after Lachhman's passing, known as 'Ekadashi', the preparations culminated as the community gathered around the sacred grove, reproducing an air of unity. In the heart of the crowd stood the Jamadar's family donned in new clothes, their eyes gleaming with somber respect and resolve.

The invocation of ancestors began with the eldest son summoning his father's soul, followed by the rhythmic chants echoing from the villagers. Every invocation was treated like an invite to a grand feast, the 'Kalu Panda'. The chorus of their voices mixed with the humming wind, creating a mesmerizing symphony that seemed to transcend the border between this world and the next.

The feast, a delectable mix of millet pancakes drizzled with wild honey and jaggery dumplings, was laid on banana leaves around the sacred grove. The delicate aroma permeated the cool mountain air, creating a sensation of simultaneous sadness and celebration.

As the first light of dawn filtered through the trees, symbolizing the presence of the ancestors, the feast was silently consumed by the family, the very act considered as a sharing of the meal with the departed soul. The sun continued to rise as the voices died down, each individual lost in silent appreciation of the wise Jamadar and his journey beyond.

The 'Kalu Panda', in its elegance, transformed a somber death ritual into a celebration of life. Rather than lamenting Lachhman's departure, the Kondh community chose to remember and honour their beloved leader through a feast - connecting the ends of life and death through a mundane act of eating, as they believed that in death, as in life, no one ought to be alone or hungry. Each feast thus keeps alive a fragment of the departed, reminding them that the cycle of life and death was but a continuum."
Story5,"Title: The Firefly’s Farewell: Rituals of the Tribal Odisha

River valleys and forested domain of Odisha are home to the Koya tribe who radiates their deep ancestral connection not just with the earth, but also with the heavens. Among the many vibrant practices they observe, the unique death ritual called 'Makku Ruka', or waving fire, serves as a sacred goodbye, connecting the departed with the cosmos.

This tale circles around the life of Kanha, an old Koya tribal elder, loved for his insightful folklores under the majestic silk cotton tree. Known as the 'storyteller of the stars,' he enchanted children with tales of cosmic bonds, making the velvety night sky seem closer to their hilltop hamlet. When Kanha joined the celestial bodies he once talked about, his adoring community prepared for his 'Makku Ruka'.

The 'Makku Ruka' ritual symbolizes guiding the departed soul toward the cosmos. It utilizes fire, considered the Koya tribe's primal companion, as the elemental guide. When the night draped the village in a starry canvas, the ritual commenced, turning sorrow into a celestial farewell.

First, an 'Arwa', a rustic bamboo torch was traditionally prepared, fueled with dried leaves. Kanha's eldest son lit the 'Arwa', a beacon illuminating in the heart of the melancholic tribe. The night echoed with rhythmic chants and the ethereal glow magnified their earnest prayers intended to guide Kanha's spirit home.

Simultaneously, in creation of an earthy canvas, the village children filled their tiny hands with mountain mud and made 'Bija', small cones resembling fireflies. A tiny flame was carefully placed atop each 'Bija', representing Kanha's cordial firefly tales, hoping that these earthly fireflies would remind him of his beloved home.

The 'Arwa' torch and 'Bija' fireflies were then released into the nurturing night. The more they drifted further into the darkness, the more they resembled shooting stars, their radiant trajectory alluding to Kanha’s celestial journey upward. The sight of a dark sky illuminated by these ephemeral fireflies crafted an intimate link between the earthly and the heavenly, mirroring the cyclical journey of life and death.

The 'Makku Ruka' ritual, a brilliant spectacle of flickering lights against a velvet canvas, offered a sublime farewell. It demonstrated how even in death, life found ways of expressing itself in forms as humble yet significant as a firefly's glow or a shooting star's trail. Kanha’s stories lived on, just like the fireflies in the night, guiding the tribe toward their celestial home.

In essence, the Koya tribe's unique death ceremony highlighted the interconnectedness of the earthly and the celestial world. It celebrated the idea of death not as an end but as a radiant transformation, a journey from the earthly firefly to the celestial star, thus weaving the tale of the continual dance between life and death."
Story6,"Title: The Echoing Farewell: A Tale from Odisha

In the ancient, fertile lands of Odisha, India, there are multiple ethnicities and tribes each contributing to the aura of diversity. The Baiga tribe, a primitive community known for their intimate alliance with nature, believed that death was the beginning of a soul's journey towards the sacred 'Maa Dharti' (Mother Earth). Their unique death ritual, 'The Samra Devi', tells a tale of an unforgettable song and the celebration of the continuity of life unseen in the conscious realm. 

Sohail, an elderly Baiga, revered as a priest, a 'Bhumia', was not just a spiritual guide but the tribe's heartbeat. His tales of mighty tigers, benevolent trees, and the 'Samra Devi's' wisdom echoed around the community. His demise left the tribe in sorrow. His departure meant losing a keeper of ancient wisdom, and the duty now fell upon them to honor his life's legacy and guide his soul back to 'Maa Dharti'.

A 'Samra Devi' was constructed in Sohail's honor. It was an embellished statue, crafted entirely from freshly foraged bamboo, dressed in saffron, symbolizing purity, and radiating a subtle, divine glow. The 'Samra Devi', considered an embodiment of the departed’s soul, was treated with the same reverence the tribe had shown Sohail throughout his life.

Night descended, the time had come to initiate Sohail's farewell. The villagers gathered around the central tree, a sacred peepal under which the 'Samra Devi' was gently placed, capturing everyone's undivided attention. The atmosphere filled with poignant hymns resonating from handmade 'Mandal' drums, and the villagers' voices, known as the 'Song of Samra'. The 'Song of Samra', ethereal and melancholic, reflected the village’s sorrow, and hope for Sohail's peaceful journey beyond.

On the twelfth day following Sohail's demise, the 'Song of Samra' sung at dawn and dusk reached its peak. The tribe believed their song was a guiding force, a pull, aiding Sohail's transition into the arms of 'Maa Dharti'. As a symbol of his finally reached destination, the 'Samra Devi' was gently immersed in the village river, a reverential goodbye witnessed plaintively by everyone.

Following 'Samra Devi's' departure, the tribe conducted 'Maha Bhoj', a grand feast signifying acceptance and celebration of life’s continual cycle. Sharing meals, laughter, and Sohail's tales, refortified their belief in the power of community and resilience. 

The 'Samra Devi' tradition, though centered around the end of physical life; profoundly affirmed the belief in life beyond the mortal frame. Through sonorous songs, a saffron idol, and shared meals, the tribe navigated the harsh reality of death and turned it into a harmonious acceptance of life's mystery. In this interconnected dance of life and death, the Baiga tribe found a balance and emphasized that even in death, life resonates."
Story7,"Title: The Unending Journey: A Sarakara Ritual

In the winding bylanes of the mystical city of Puri in Odisha, weaving its narrative among a myriad of age-old customs and ethereal belief systems, the death ritual known as 'Moha Jatra', or the grand journey, functions as an integral part of the societal weave. This ritual showcases the transformation of mourning into a poetic homecoming dedicated to departed souls.

Our story revolves around the unassuming life of Surya Babu, a traditional 'Ratha' or chariot carpenter. Known for his intricate artisanship during the renowned ‘Ratha Jatra' festival in Puri, he crafted chariots which bore the holy trinity of Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra. His passing left a void in the artisan community and his family prepared for his 'Moha Jatra' with a heavy heart.

The 'Moha Jatra', the Sarakara (artisan) community's distinctive ritual, believed in transforming the departed soul into a celestial voyager. Echoing the essence of ‘Ratha Jatra’, the journey began with crafting a small, exquisite bamboo chariot or 'Ratha'. This miniature 'Ratha', symbolizing Surya Babu's vital connection with his craft, was to carry his soul on a divine journey.

As per tradition, his body was placed on a bier, ‘Khatol’, covered with a white shroud, bearing the sacred 'Ratha', symbolizing Surya Babu's eternal vocation. As his final journey commenced, the ‘Moha Jatra’, akin to ‘Ratha Jatra’, began. The firstborn son tugged the chariot carrying Surya Babu, symbolic of the grand journey of life and the inevitability of death. 

The lanes echoed with rhythmic chants and the melancholic gongs of the 'Gini', a handcrafted bell, summoning the reverence of onlookers. This procession continued up to the city outskirts ‘Swargadwara’, the ceremonial cremation ground, where the 'Ratha' was offered to the ensuing flames, ushering Surya Babu's transit from the earthly life to the celestial realm.

Following the cremation, the family and fellow artisans congregated for the 'Seemanth', a ritualized feast. Together they shared stories about Surya Babu, his profound knowledge, and the undeniable impact he had upon Puri's artistic heritage. Sharing food and fond memories, they celebrated his life, thus gradually transforming their sorrow into remembrance and appreciation.

The 'Moha Jatra', although centered around the end of life, romantically mirrored the continuity of existence showcasing life's cyclical journey. Through the emulation of 'Ratha Jatra', a radiant chariot, and shared meals, the Sarakara community found solace and a medium to navigate the unfathomable depths of death. Their unique practice subtly transformed a seeming end into an ethereal journey, a grand voyage befitting the chariot maker's spirit, hinting at the unending voyage of existence."
Story8,"Title: The Eternal Companion: A Ritual of the Ghasi Tribe

The diverse land of Odisha, with its abundant ethnic and tribal culture, is home to the relatively lesser-known Ghasi tribe. Subsisting predominantly on forest produce, the community practices a unique death ritual known as the 'Podan Shram', or the gifting of the bowl. This ritual signifies the passing of life into another realm, with personified elements assisting the transition. Here is a tale of such a ritual revolving around Munda, the tribe's oldest member.

Munda, a seasoned hunter known for his impeccable skills and avuncular disposition, was greatly respected among the Ghasis. Having led them in countless hunting expeditions and safeguarded their harmony with the forest, his demise struck a sorrowful chord across the tribe. However, sorrow was soon replaced with deep reverence as the close-knit tribe gathered to perform the 'Podan Shram' ritual.

As per their tradition, the 'Podan Shram', literally meaning 'to gift a bowl', involved the crafting of a bowl from the bark of the sacred Sal tree. This 'Podan' was considered an essential vessel for the departed soul’s journey into the afterlife. It was believed that the departed would require sustenance during the journey, much like a traveling hunter. Thus, the 'Podan' was filled with wild honey, roots, berries, and any other edibles available.

On the day of the funeral, everyone from the community came together, their faces marked with somber respect. Munda's body was adorned with Sal leaves while the 'Podan' was placed strategically beside the body, signifying Munda's last hunting expedition.

Post-cremation, the 'Podan' was kept on a raised platform called 'Dharm Ghara' for twelve days, a period of mourning for the tribe. Each day was enveloped with the chanting of elegiac hymns, ceremonial dances, feasts, and remembrance paeans that celebrated Munda's life.

On the twelfth day, the decorated 'Podan' was taken far into the woods amidst a solemn procession. It was buried in a flowering patch of forest edge, an act symbolizing the return of the 'Podan' along with Munda's spirit to the nurturing bosom of the forest – their eternal home.

This unique tradition of the 'Podan Shram' wasn't merely about mourning; it was about accepting and respectfully dispatching the departed on their final voyage. Whether Munda's stories whispered in the winds or his spirit drenched with the forest's essence, the Ghasi tribe believed, life went on, with death just another destination in the grand journey, gracefully merging nature and culture. In the Podan's reciprocation, a hunter's departure to his eternal hunting grounds was ever-glowing, embedded in the tribe's heart and soul."
Story9,"Title: The Dance of Departure: A Tribal Farewell in Odisha

In the forested backdrop of Koraput district in Odisha resides the Paraja tribe, rooted deeply in their rich traditions and animated cultural ethos. One such unique ceremonial progression is their death ritual known as 'Katrei Dans', or the death-dance, a soulful departure song for the departed.

Our story contemplates the life of a tribal woman Lata, renowned for her traditional medicinal knowledge across the tribe and the neighbouring Paroja settlements. Her sudden demise left the community in collective grief, making the essence of 'Katrei Dans' more profound than ever.

Being a significantly valued member of the tribe, Lata’s death ceremonies needed to capture her revered status. The tribe got together for the preparation. The event was a two-fold process involving the tribal music and dance called 'Dhemsha' and crafting a symbolic entity known as 'Saja'.

Firstly, 'Dhemsha', a traditional dance performed amidst soulful drum beats and the rhythmic clapping of cymbals, began at the dawn following Lata's demise. The dancers, primarily women of all ages, swirled to the music's rhythm, their movements culminating in an all-consuming vortex of shared sorrow and celebration of Lata's impactful life.

The 'Saja', a large-sized doll made entirely out of forest bamboo and deftly decorated with local flowers and colourful clothes, represented Lata's earthly manifestation. Considered an embodiment of the departed soul, the 'Saja' was placed at the heart of the wake, silently observing the ongoing dances.

As the final day approached, the 'Katrei Dans' reached its zenith. The heart-wrenching yet majestic spectacle of tribal men and women, painted in grief, continued dancing around the 'Saja', their steps echoing the heartbeat of the tribe, their collective mourning, and the celebration of Lata’s life.

Towards the end of the ceremony, as the tribal drums resonated the loudest, the 'Saja' was finally released into the nearby river, symbolizing Lata's spirit being guided back to nature, her eternal dwelling. The departure, marked by the finale of the 'Katrei Dans', left an eerie stillness in its wake, an echo of an end.

The Paraja's 'Katrei Dans' death Ritual captures the delicate dance of life and death, celebrating death as an essential element of life rather than a mournful end. The thematic vibration of tribal music, dances around the 'Saja', and the eventual return of Lata's symbolic statue to nature highlighted the belief in life's continuous cycle and death's role as a mere rite of passage in this never-ending dance of existence."
Story10,"Title: Journey to the Bamboo Grove: A Juang Tribe Ritual

The remote highlands of Keonjhar district in Odisha is the abode of the Juang tribe, who nurture a profound bond with nature. Honoring the cycle of birth and death, their unique death ritual is the 'Baansa Chaada,' a final voyage symbolized through a customary bamboo raft. The death of an elderly tribesman, Chaitanya, helps us explore this tradition.

Chaitanya was a well-loved figure. His death at the ripe age of ninety-five brought forth a sorrowful hush in the village. He was to be given the highest honor in death - the ceremonial 'Baansa Chadaa.' 

Strong, supple bamboo, a material central to their daily lives, was harvested fresh by the men of the tribe. A raft was carefully constructed, symbolising the vessel to carry the departed soul through its remaining journey. Chaitanya's body was tenderly washed, covered in white muslin, and adorned with forest flowers. He was then placed atop the bamboo raft, his possessions placed around him.

As the women ululated, a reverberating soundtrack that echoed the sorrowful yet respectful ambiance, the men carried the bamboo raft to the sacred grove. This hallowed grove resided by a dense bamboo thicket, securing the essence of their ancestors and their profound faith in nature.

During sunset, the procession reached its destination. The bamboo raft carrying Chaitanya was levitated on sturdy stands, and the tribe bid their earthly farewell. As the night deepened, the priest chanted verses asking for a safe journey for Chaitanya's soul.

The bamboo raft ('Baansa Chadaa'), symbolizing the last voyage, was then abandoned to nature. Over time, the bamboo would decay, beautifully merging with the sacred forest floor. This signalled the completion of Chaitanya's journey, his physical form returned to nature, symbolising a life lived in harmony, now peacefully at rest.

In their veneration of the departed and the sacred bamboo, the Juang people beautifully enshrined the concept of death's universality and life's return to nature—an echo of the enduring interconnectivity between humanity and the natural world. The 'Baansa Chaadaa' reflected the acceptance of death's inevitability and celebrated the cyclical dance of existence, channeled eloquently through their bamboo voyage to eternity."
Story11,"Title: The Passage Through Silk Cotton: A Death Ritual of the Bhuyan Tribe

In the hinterlands of the Mayurbhanj District, Odisha, settles the largely agrarian Bhuiyan tribe. Known for their profound reverence for natural elements, they believe in life's cyclical journey harmoniously tied with nature. It's their death ritual, 'The Semal Dana', which symbolizes life's return to the divine womb of nature, that forms the crux of our story.

Balram, a revered elder and the keeper of tribal lore, peacefully completed his mortal journey. Much loved and admired for his wisdom, his passing marked a poignant moment for the Bhuiyan tribe. Yet, it was accepted stoically, considering death as a passage to a different existence rather than an untimely cessation—a thread woven into the Bhuyan’s 'Semal Dana' death ritual.

The 'Semal Dana', or the ritual of Silk Cotton giving, emerged from the Bhuiyan's deep reverence for the majestic Semal tree, or Silk Cotton tree. Believed to be 'Pitru Vriksha', or Ancestor tree, the ritual involved forming a symbolic bridge between the departed and the ancestral realm using the Semal tree's attributes.

Commencing on the third day post demise, the first component involved extracting the sap of the Semal tree. The sap delicately collected in a clay pot symbolized the nourishing essence being offered to the departed soul. Simultaneously, silk cotton from the tree was collected, embodying the purity, comfort, and protection for the soul on its celestial journey.

On the day of cremation, Balram's body, adorned with fresh Marigold garlands, was gently anointed in the sap, the sweet scent mixing with the somber silence of the moment. The silk cotton was then placed over Balram, his body blanketed in an earthly cocoon, embodying the tribe's belief in his becoming, rather than his ending.

A community feast, ‘Mahabhoj’, marked the completion of the ritual, where stories were shared, laughter echoed, and Balram's life was celebrated, portraying death as an integral part of life's chain.

The 'Semal Dana' ritual resonates a tribe's communion with nature, positioning death into the continuity of life through the symbolic use of the Silk Cotton tree. The Bhuiyans' acceptance and celebration of death using nature's instruments transcends an end into a beautiful process of becoming, re-defining the narrative of death and highlighting the importance of the philosophical position of life in the grand cosmic scheme."
Story12,"Title: ""The Rite of Robi Gara: Ascending to the Celestial Abode.""

Mesmerizingly woven in the lush fabric of eastern Odisha are numerous tribal communities, each brimming with their rich culture and customs. Among such vibrant tribes are the Santals, who observe a unique death ritual known as 'Robi Gara' or the Ascending Stairway.

The protagonist of our story was none other than the nimble weaver of Sundargarh village – Kishore. A man of humble origins, his deft weaving skills and nature-loving personality had made him a beloved figure in the community. When Kishore returned to the cosmic lap, it was incumbent on the tribe to engage the 'Robi Gara', ensuring his peaceful ascension to the ancestral realm.

Following Kishore's departure, a mound of freshly harvested earth was prepared near the entrance of his home, the thick earthen aroma enveloping the gloomy evening air. That evening was to serve as the introductory phase of the 'Robi Gara,,' with the creation of a symbolic stairway for Kishore's heavenly journey.

In a gesture of familial unity, the mound was carved into a miniature stairway by Kishore's sons and nephews. The perfect number of steps represented Kishore’s decades of life, each hand-carved step counting for ten of Kishore's fruitful years. Unified and determined, they sculpted an earthly stairway to the heavens, adorned with blossoming Marigold and Gondhoraj, tokens of respect for the departed soul.

The ceremonial farewell, the 'Janjati Nrutya', began at dusk, transforming the hushed silence into a respectful celebration of Kishore’s life. The villagers gathered around the 'Robi Gara’ and shared tales of Kishore’s weaves, his laughter, and the aromatic Gondhoraj close to his atelier.

Following the last dance and the final goodbye, Kishore's wife solemnly placed his favorite handwoven Mekhela and the woven loom he always wore on the topmost stair. This was to provide the departed soul comfort on his celestial journey.

On the remaining days of mourning, villagers shared 'Ukhuda,' sweetened puffed rice, acknowledging Kishore's consequential influence on their lives as they reminisced about their weaver's charismatic persona. 

Completing the 'Robi Gara' ritual provided the tribespeople a peaceful closure, reconciling Kishore's sudden absence with the comforting presence of his legacy among them. Whether it was his weaves swaying under the banyan tree or the lingering aroma of Gondhoraj, Kishore lived on through their shared memories. 

In the recollection of these rituals, customs, and emotions, death was unfettered from its morbid shroud, redefined as an ascension to a higher realm and a continuation of life and influence beyond the earthly confines."
Story13,"Title: The Voyage of the Soul: A Ritual from Odisha’s Toda Tribe 

Amid the verdant expanses of the Similipal Forest in Odisha, dwells the enigmatic Toda tribe. Their bond with their environment transcends life and death, a concept eloquently symbolized in their death ritual, 'Amtola Parikrama' or the soul’s circumambulation.

Predominantly a pastoral community, the Toda tribe was known for the Gardua, the leaders adorned in colourful handwoven shawls who guided their cattle and people alike. Ramakanta, the beloved Gardua of his tribe, left on his heavenly journey at an advanced age. His death triggered his transition through the 'Amtola Parikrama'. 

The primary element of the ritual was Amtola, a ghost tree believed to be spiritually potent. The Toda Tribe believed that the departed soul circumambulated around this tree on its voyage to the divine realm. The process of 'Amtola Parikrama' was done in three stages.

The first stage involved a sacred march around the Amtola tree, led by Ramakanta’s eldest son and followed by the villagers. The tribe moved in silence, their solemn faces lit under the pale moonlight, the ghost tree watching over their procession. It was their sacred way of guiding Ramakanta's soul and marking the beginning of his ethereal journey.

On the third day post Ramakanta's demise, the second stage of the ceremony was observed. This involved the construction of a small memorial or 'Manji' close to the Amtola tree. Minimal and built out of local materials, the 'Manji' symbolized Ramakanta's connection to his tribe, bringing a sense of solace to the villagers.

Upon the completion of the 'Manji,' the final stage commenced – the community feast or 'Jagar Bhoji.' Foods that Ramakanta loved were prepared, with mutton and rice fermented in Sal leaves served to all villagers. This feast commemorated Ramakanta's life, his love for his people, and his gentle guidance, replacing grief with shared joy.

By the end of the 'Amtola Parikrama,' a serene calm resided over the Toda tribe. The villagers believed that Ramakanta's soul had successfully finished its circumambulation and found solace in the divine realm. His memory lived on within his people, the 'Manji,' and the Amtola tree.

The Toda tribe's 'Amtola Parikrama,' with its sacred tree, silent march, and shared meals, presented a serene portrait of death. Their ritual served not only as a farewell to Ramakanta but also as a celebration of his life and the journey of the soul, emphasizing that death, like life, is a sacred passage in the greater scheme of existence and harmony with nature."

Overlooking the impressive expanse of the Eastern Ghats, the Majhi tribes of Odisha's Koraput district epitomize resilience and unflustered adherence to age-old rituals. The due belief of life's continuity after a person's physical end manifests distinctly in their death ritual - 'Deep Malika', the garland of lights. The abrupt departure of their beloved village healer, Sudarshan, brings this ritual to life.

Respected and cherished for his healing knowledge, Sudarshan’s peacefully slipped into eternity, his physical absence announcing the commencement of the 'Deep Malika'. Symbolizing light's eternal journey, it assists the spirit in its journey to the afterlife with due honor.

The central ritual involved crafting an intricate diya or lamp structure, the 'Deep Malika'. Constructed from locally sourced bamboo sticks and clay, the 'Malika' had several tiny niches to hold earthen lamps, reflecting the tribe's sustainable practices.

Post Sudarshan’s final rites, the 'Deep Malika' was erected at the village entrance. As twilight descended, each family from the Majhi tribe lit a diya within the 'Deep Malika'. Every flickering flame embodied an individual's heartfelt prayer and love for Sudarshan, resulting in a radiant structure illuminating their silent prayers.

For twelve nights, the Majhis congregated around the 'Deep Malika', their chatter interspersed with poignant silences, healing laughter, and shared remembrance of Sudarshan’s life. With every dawn, the lamps were refilled with fresh oil and wicks, their burning flames symbolizing the ongoing journey of the departed into the ethereal realm.

As the twelfth day dawned, the 'Deep Malika' reached its journey’s final phase. The glowing structure was ceremonially immersed into the river nearby. As the ethereal glow dissipated into the tranquil waters, it marked Sudarshan's successful voyage into peace, unity, and the cosmic embrace.

After Sudarshan’s farewell, the Majhi tribe, showered with the magnificent glow reflected on the murkiness of death. Through shared memories, lighted diyas, and an ethereal 'Deep Malika', they saw death not as a definitive end but as a radiant bridge to a new celestial existence.

The Majhis' death ritual, 'Deep Malika', demonstrates a sonic interplay between light and darkness, life and death, revealing an enriched understanding of the circle of life. Every lit diya, every shared meal, and every whispered remembrance converged into an understanding that our existence, like the everlasting glow of a humble diya, remains unending, shifting forms yet forever emanating light."
Story15,"Title: The Eternity in Clay: A Ritual of the Munda Tribe

Located in the hilly terrains of Sundargarh in Odisha resides the Munda tribe, known for their deep-seated connection with nature and inherent artistic sensitivities. Their unique death ritual, 'Mitti Ka Chitra,' or the clay mural, is a touching tribute to the departed, as they symbolize their loved ones as characters revered through life.

Our tale focuses on the life and death of Ambika, a joyous Munda woman, known for her radiant persona. Her songs, an intangible heritage echoing through the wilderness, mirrored her love for the tribe, woven in melodious recitations. Her sudden demise left the tribe in profound bereavement, following which the ritual of 'Mitti Ka Chitra' was initiated.

The process of 'Mitti Ka Chitra' began with the extraction of clay from a sacred pond nearby. The tribe believed the clay's divine influence resonated the cyclical connection between birth, death, rebirth, and the Earth's nurturing embrace. Ambika's son, a devoted clay artist, took the responsibility of extracting the clay, which would serve as the primary medium to commemorate his mother's life.

Next, on a clay canvas prepared on the eastern wall of Ambika's abode, the son started creating the clay mural, 'Mitti Ka Chitra.' The mural captured the essence of Ambika's special moments—her singing by the river, the joy in her dance during harvest festivals, and her warm conversations around the community fire.

With each etched line, her son painted a vivid picture of his mother’s life, every curve and impression was symbolic to Ambika’s journey. The process was patiently observed by the grieving tribe, the transformational act of sculpting bringing comfort and a sense of unbroken connection with their beloved Ambika.

Having completed the mural in the following days, the final part of the ritual was a ceremonial prayer. The tribe gathered before dawn by the mural and sang Ambika's favorite songs, their unified voices believed to guide the departed soul towards a peaceful transition in the afterlife.

The 'Mitti Ka Chitra' ritual reflects the Munda belief of death, not as an end, but as a significant thread in the tapestry of life. The creation of the clay mural transformed a mourning period into a tribute, a celebration of Ambika’s life where she was remembered through an everlasting artistic representation. The clay mural served as a time capsule, echoing stories of Ambika’s life and resonated with the Munda belief: Life finds a way to etch its presence in death, its echo resonating through the vast halls of eternity.

Deep within the heartland of India, there is a unique community dedicated to the rhythm and melody of life – The Gotipua dance practitioners of Odisha’s Raghurajpur village. Gotipua, a traditional dance form typically practiced by young boys dressed as women, compiles a divine premiere of Odisha’s vibrant culture and ethos. Along with their rich customs is a unique death ritual, ‘Nritya Samarpana’ – the dance surrender, which immortalizes the departed individual's life.

Bhabanishankar, the eldest Gotipua practitioner in the community, was revered for his contributions as a maestro and mentor. His soulful renditions not only gave Raghurajpur its fame but also enlightened many young minds – shaping them into gifted Gotipuas. His sudden departure left the dance fraternity in profound sorrow, marking the ceremonial stage for 'Nritya Samarpana’.

Bhabanishankar’s life had been dedicated to Gotipua, and his death ceremony was to mirror his lifelong passion. The ritual would combine the observance of a holy dance marathon or ‘Maharaas’ with a traditional feast, ‘Bandapana’. 

Post his mortal rites, preparations for the ‘Maharaas’ started. ‘Maharaas’, a dance marathon, was a customary ritual in Gotipua. Bhabanishankar's disciples dedicatedly rehearsed his favorite sequences, ready to reverberate their guru's wisdom and love for Gotipua in their synchronized movements. 

On the thirteenth day post his demise, ‘Trayodashi’, a makeshift stage ‘Nata Mandap’ was prepared at the village center. As the sun set, the solemn strumming of 'Mardala’ and the surreal tunes of ‘Bansi’ began, marking the onset of ‘Maharaas’. The delicate jingle of ghungroos, the vibrant attire of young Gotipuas, and their flowing movements against the twilight created a divine spectacle under the starlit sky.

The ‘Maharaas’ continued till dawn, a solemn yet grand homage to their beloved guru. As the dance recitation concluded, the ritual culminated into ‘Bandapana’, a grand feast for all villagers. Together they shared meals, relieved Bhabanishankar’s fond memories, and celebrated his legacy.

The routine of ‘Nritya Samarpana’ wasn’t just a goodbye, but it immortalized Bhabanishankar’s essence through a dedicated Odissi dance marathon. The ritual transformed the traditional performance stage into a platform of shared memories, inner peace, and communal unity that transcended the boundaries of life and death. 

Through the beats of 'Mardala', synchronised Gotipua dances, and shared meals, the dancers and villagers collectively found comfort and closure, believing that their dance guru subtly lived among them, redefining the narrative of death into a divine dance rendition."
Story17,"Title: Beneath the Sacred Tree: Ritual of the Khond Tribe

Nestled amidst the verdant valleys of the Eastern Ghats in Odisha, the Khond tribe traces their lineage back to nature itself. Revered in their oral lore, they share an innate bond with the sacred Jackfruit tree. This intimate connection permeates their death rituals, specifically the 'Panasa Patta Sradha,' translating to Jackfruit Leaf Rites.

Our narrative illuminates this ritual through the life and death of Bijoy, an elderly Khond, celebrated for his story-telling sessions. Revered as the village Bartika, he narrated tales of forest spirits and celestial beings, his stories echoing in the forest landscape long after his voice ceased to be.

Bijoy's demise triggered the preparation of the 'Panasa Patta Sradha.' Communing his connection with nature even in his departure, this ritual involved conducting post-death rites on Jackfruit leaves or 'Panasa Patta,' symbolizing the intertwining of life, death, and the elemental Earth.

Firstly, an idol of Bijoy was crafted out of 'Dhara mitti,' sacred clay extracted from riverbeds. A miniature replica, the idol was adorned with Bijoy's clothes and possessions, replicating his earthly appearance and symbolizing his presence among the tribe members.

The idol was then placed on a large Jackfruit leaf — a makeshift bier, ready to journey towards the sacred forest sanctum. Following this, a Jackfruit leaf, 'Panasa Patta', containing a small portion of the food Bijoy loved, was placed beside the idol. The villagers believed Bijoy's soul would need nourishment on its voyage to the ancestral realm.

As dusk descended, the clay idol was carried around the village in a ceremonial procession, honoring Bijoy's life and bidding him a final farewell. On reaching the sanctum, the Jackfruit leaf was ceremonially burned. The tribal elders chanted verses, releasing Bijoy's soul into the ancestors' domain.

The ritual concluded with 'Bada Parab,' a community feast, the following day. Sharing a meal cooked over the sacred flame, the village came together, recounting memories of Bijoy's vivacious spirit and his enchanting tales.

The 'Panasa Patta Sradha' ritual of the Khond tribe highlights a death not as an end, but as a continuation of existence in a different realm. Through sacred clay, Jackfruit leaves, and communal feasts, the villagers found solace. They believed that, much like his fabled tales, Bijoy's spirit remained with them — a constant reminder of the harmonious dance of life and death."
Story18,"Title: The Boatman’s Voyage: A Ritual from Odisha’s Khond Tribe

Tucked away amidst the verdant valleys of the Eastern Ghats in Odisha, the Khond Tribe closely knot with their lands through symbiosis and spirituality. Their relationship with death is no exception - epitomized in the unique death ritual, the 'Nauka Dana,' or the gifting of the boat.

Our narrative’s protagonist is Manoj, the revered boatman of the Khond’s riverside village. His uncanny knowledge of the waterways, combined with an affable smile, made him a highly cherished figure. Manoj’s sudden departure left the tribe in shared sorrow, and the 'Nauka Dana' was orchestrated to honour his spirit’s passage into the afterlife.

As per tradition, a boat, made from the bark of a Sal tree, was crafted by Manoj’s eldest son. Woven with the tribe’s shared love and grief, the boat was a symbolic reminder of Manoj's river voyages. 

At the rising of the morning sun, Manoj was lovingly clothed in fresh white garb and seated upright in the crafted boat. The entire community escorted Manoj’s final procession to the bank of the serene river. 

As the villagers gathered, the tribal priest performed ‘Jala Puja,' paying homage to the water deity and seeking a safe passage for Manoj. The grieving tribe sang ancestral songs, a melancholic symphony to accompany Manoj’s journey.

With the arrival of high tide, the boat carrying Manoj was sent adrift. It was a sight of breathtaking poignancy - the tiny boat, holding their beloved boatman, being gradually swallowed by the rippling water. His son gave the final push to the boat, symbolizing the releasing of his spirit to the beckoning horizon.

On the thirteenth day following Manoj's departure, 'Ashara’ was observed, a feast to commemorate his life. An elaborate banquet was prepared, and stories of Manoj, his joyful laughter, and his unfaltering navigation skills were shared – reinforcing their shared memories and unity.

The 'Nauka Dana' manifested the tribe’s belief in the cyclical relationship of life and death. The sentiment associated with crafting the boat, the poignant voyage, and the unity at 'Ashara' - all collaborated to create a comforting embrace for Manoj’s departure. His life as a boatman had navigated the tribe through life, and his death would guide them through the comprehension of mortality.

While the river's rhythmic lapping took Manoj away from their sight, the rituals anchored him forever in their hearts - just like his boat, adrift yet purposeful, forever remembered in the grandeur of the mighty river’s tale."

In the verdant valleys encompassing pockets of East India, the Koya tribe harmoniously co-exists with nature. Their customs deeply rooted in their environment and heroic tales passed down generations echo this profound relationship. Tucked away in this unique life fabric, the traditional death ritual, 'Pabu Sradha' or the Grand Goodbye, highlights their intimate liaison with life's transience and death's remnant echoes.

This chronicle details the farewell ceremony of Agastya, an honourable tribal elder and skilled weaver. Known for his woven stories and excellence in the indigenous 'Dongria' shawls weaving, Agastya's life touched every hut and heart in the settlement. His unexpected departure called for the 'Pabu Sradha,' a powerful testament to Agastya's life resonated through customs and community reverence.

Agastya, during his lifetime, had nurtured a Sal tree, the 'Pabu Vriksha' – a living memoir of his existence. Following his demise, this sacred tree transformed into the 'Pabu Sradha's' centerpiece. A mark of respect and an eternal reminder, the tree served the dual purpose of a memorial and congregation point for the post-death rituals.

The first part of the ritual involved 'Mani Karan,' a colourful garland crafted from fresh forest flowers, placed around 'Pabu’s' thick trunk as a symbolic embrace. The next segment included 'Prasada Visharjana,' where his favourite food offerings were ceremonially laid at the tree’s base, a way for the community to share a last meal with their departed weaver.

In the evening under the shimmering starlight, the mournful silence was replaced by the 'Adivasi Sangeet.’ The tribal choir sang their traditional hymns, the notes dedicatingly mirroring Agastya's life and holding the promise of strength to the grieving community. As their united voices pulsed into the sacred Sal tree's silence, Agastya’s thoughts, decisions, and stories inevitably lived through every sung syllable.

Through the following weeks, the tribe collectively paid their respects to Agastya – singing, sharing memories, and offering food under the same tree he once rested. Over time, every anecdote, song, and shared meal made Agastya a living memory, celebrated through the very Sal tree he loved.

The Koya tribe's 'Pabu Sradha' reflects their holistic perspective of life and death, where death forms an integral part of the life cycle. By memorializing Agastya through the Sal tree, shared meals, and tribal music, they threaded a part of him within the perennials of their culture - a perfect blend of love, respect, and remembrance that made Agastya a living echo in the Koya tribe’s eternal symphony."

In the hilly heartland of Kandhamal, Odisha, the Kondhs Tribe resides, steeped in mesmerizing customs and animistic beliefs. Their deep-seated bond with nature finds expression in their unique death ritual - the 'Divine Umbrella,' or 'Devjhadu' - a ceremonial farewell that commemorates the journey of the departed soul towards eternity.

Our tale centers around the life of Girija, a revered tribal woman, known for her enchanting folk songs. Her voice, entwined with tales of gods, forests, and unhindered love, echoed in the wilderness, painting pictures of her vibrant spirit. Girija's sudden departure doused the Kondhs Tribe with collective grief, invoking the ritual of 'Devjhadu.'

Interpreted from the Kondhs community's deep-seated beliefs, the 'Devjhadu' was an ethereal creation symbolizing a divine shield to protect the departed soul. Girija's eldest son, gifted with a profound craft of making ornate umbrellas, took upon the solemn responsibility to prepare the 'Devjhadu.'  Braving his grief, he began meticulously stitching together an intricate umbrella using natural materials - bamboo, and the tribe's sacred plant - 'Jali Kadamb' leaves. 

The completion of the sacred umbrella marked the beginning of Girija's farewell. A silent procession led by her son, carrying the 'Devjhadu,' moved through the village towards the crematory ground adjacent to the sacred grove. Girija's body, adorned in her favourite saari and heirloom jewellery, was also carried along a parallel path in a ceremonial procession.

With the villagers gathered, the priest performed the 'Jadi Pujan,' paying homage to mother earth, fire, and the tribe's ancestral spirits. The 'Devjhadu' was then elevated and fastened above the funeral pyre, its leaves rustling softly, as if whispering their prayers for Girija. As the pyre was lit, the 'Devjhadu' fluttered protectively, watching over her earthly remains as they melded with the ancestral spirits.

Upon the conclusion of the cremation, the remnants of the 'Devjhadu' were collected. These were later immersed in the sacred river - an act symbolizing the conclusion of Girija’s journey from the earthly dominion to the celestial abode. The ritual concluded with ‘Prasad Vitran’, a community feast, where the tribe commemorated Girija, her songs echoing their tribute to her glorious life.

The 'Devjhadu' death ritual of the Kondhs Tribe manifests the enduring spiritual essence that transcends mortality. Through the sacred umbrella, ceremonial processions, and shared meals, they collectively found solace in the permanence of Girija's memory. Her spirit continues to live on, nurtured by her folk songs - an eternal accompaniment to the tribe's events and celebrations."

In the serene settings of Odisha, home to the vibrant and culturally rich tribal communities, a unique death ritual practiced by the Bhil tribe presents a compassionate perspective on death. Known as 'Parthana,' or the Sacred Farewell, it celebrates the life of the deceased and mirrors the Bhils' profound understanding of mortality and spirituality.

The narrative revolves around the life of Ranjit, a wise elder of the Bhil community in Mayurbhanj district. Known for his deep knowledge of medicinal herbs and their miraculous healing abilities, his unexpected death left the tribe in a state of collective loss. Aligned with their customs, the tribe decided to bid him farewell with a 'Parthana.'

Parthana involved creating a divine channel of communication between the departed and the divine through an effigy or idol called 'Batu.' Crafted from the sacred clay by the river, the Batu, resembling Ranjit, embodied his spirit and was treated with due reverence.

The community gathered around the Batu, chanting together, acknowledging and respectfully passing on Ranjit's earthly wisdom onto his divine journey.

The Bhil community's emotions culminated on the eleventh day, called 'Vinash,' marking the spiritual movement of Ranjit’s soul from the physical to the cosmic realm.

This ceremonial conclusion was followed by 'Nimantrana,' a feast where the community shared food and memories of Ranjit. The atmosphere that began with grief gradually transformed into a rhythmic symphony of reconciliation and acceptance of their healer's departure.

The 'Parthana' practiced by the Bhil tribe reiterates a fascinating perspective on death, which is considered not as an end but as a mere metamorphosis into another form of existence. Through the clay Batu, chanting verses, and communal feast, they navigate through the grief and pay homage to their loved ones, crafting a remembrance that elegantly celebrates life, death, and the continuity of existence."

The night arrived with a sense of serene melancholy. Guided by Dhulia’s rhythmic teachings, the tribe assembled under the vast night sky, encircling a brightly burning fire, Dhulia’s favorite 'Tara Dhol' rested by its side. Away from the artificial illumination, each visible star was a bereaved face, their silent twinkle imbued with Dhulia’s tales and music.

The idols were then placed around his body, creating a convoy of his lived journey.

The 'Mrinmoy' was followed by 'Pran Prastuti', an intimate homage to the departed. As the holy Bhramari Gayatri hymn echoed in the backdrop, each person approached Parikshit's body one at a time, whispering final goodbyes, sharing fond remembrances, and seeking blessings for the last time.

On the foothills of the Eastern Ghats in Odisha, the Oraon tribe practices a distinctive death ritual, providing their departed ones with a passage to the afterlife. The story revolves around 'Sutri Dhaga,' or the Thread Ceremony, conducted when their respected village elder, Dhananjay, sets off on his eternal journey.

Dhananjay, with his wealth of ancestral knowledge, was the village's guiding beacon. His stories, imbibed with values of love, respect, and unity, knit the tribe into a close-knit family. His sudden demise triggered prophesying silence, and the tribe initiated the 'Sutri Dhaga,' a vibrant ritual of subtle nuances that pay homage to Dhananjay.

The first step involved the crafting of a sacred thread, the 'Sutri Dhaga'. Women from the tribe prepared it from spindles of raw cotton. It was both an artwork and a prayer, their nimble fingers spinning an unending bond between Dhananjay and those he left behind.

Simultaneously, Dhananjay's body was clothed in traditional tribal attire and adorned with his personal belongings. His forehead was smeared with sacred rice paste, and the 'Sutri Dhaga' was tied around his wrist, symbolizing a profound connection with the tribe's living members. 

After the tying of the thread, three successive circumambulations were performed around Dhananjay's body. The respect-laden walk around was the tribe's symbol of continuity, of unity, and of life that continues despite death. 

Post the cremation, Dhananjay's ashes were ceremoniously collected and immersed in the holy Kolab river, marked by enchanting hymns and solemn prayers. The completion of these rites didn't mark the end of remembrance; instead, it initiated a period of mourning and celebration of Dhananjay's remarkable life.

High up in the remote Malkangiri district of Odisha, the Bonda tribe has lived in the mystical mountains. Known for their unique customs and bold spirit, their death ritual, 'Swarga Nrutya', or the Dance Towards Heaven intricately threads celestial belief into the fabric of their lives. The story revolves around this ritual waged on the death of their legendary chief, Abhiram.

Abhiram was an skilled archer and an informant of the tribe's storied past. His unexpected passing saddened the tribe, and they prepared for the 'Swarga Nrutya' to pay homage to his far-reaching influence.

The first phase involved the crafting of 'Dhokra' - small brass figurines depicting Abhiram engaged in varied actions of his life - hunting, dancing and storytelling. The 'Dhokra' were meant to keep Abhiram's memory alive, marking the landmarks of his life in brass that withstands the passage of time.

On the night of Abhiram's cremation, the tribal folk gathered in their community hall, 'Akhaada.' The air filled with sombre anticipation, ready to perform the 'Swarga Nrutya.'

At twilight, as the stars shone brightest, a rhythmic orchestra of tribal drums, 'Mardalas,' began playing. Men, women, and children of the tribe began dancing, their bodies swaying in a meditative trance. Their movements became a silent prayer, seeking cosmic guidance to direct Abhiram's spirit towards Swarga, the celestial abode.

Soon, the 'Dhokra' was brought forth, and each figure was circled round in the tribal dance one by one. Each time a 'Dhokra' was placed back, a farewell song encapsulating the tale captured in brass was sung. This was their way to thank Abhiram for his varied contributions to the tribe and their shared lifestyle.

As dawn approached, the dance gradually slowed, the music softened, marking an end indicating Abhiram's successful passage to the celestial realms. The tribe then partook in 'Maha Bhoj,' a grand feast celebrating Abhiram's glorious life. His stories filled the morning air, turning tears of mourning into smiles of remembrance, wrapping the entire tribe in the warmth of their shared memory of Abhiram.

'Swarga Nrutya' beautifully showcases the Bonda tribe's belief in life beyond death and death itself as a celestial transition. It brings closure and creates a space that caters to their communal feeling of loss. It immortalizes Abhiram, transforming his stories into a kaleidoscope of memories and rituals, a silent reminder of their cosmic dance of birth, life, death, and the beyond.

Story26,"Title: Guided by Light: The Bhatta Tribe's Ritual of 'Deepamukha'

In the rural landscapes of the Koraput district in Odisha, exists the culturally expressive Bhatta tribe. Among the multitudes of customs and rituals they follow, their death ceremonial practice is both a poignant farewell and a welcoming beacon to the afterlife, famously known as 'Deepamukha,' or the Face of Light.

The narrative centers around the elderly medicine woman, Bimala, adored for her vast knowledge of herbal remedies and nurturing spirit. Her untimely death left the Bhatta community in profound sorrow. However, in their shared loss loomed the preparations for her 'Deepamukha.' 

'Deepamukha,' as the Bhattas believe, is an ethereal apparition of ultimate enlightenment that guides the soul's journey towards liberation. The ritual entailed constructing a lantern known as 'Jyoti Deep,' which involved meticulous crafting from locally sourced bamboo, thread, and handmade paper, loaded with natural resin to keep the flame glowing for several hours. 

Following Bimala's last rites, at the crack of dawn, a solemn procession took the 'Jyoti Deep' through the village, symbolizing the soul's journey from earthly matter to divine light. A substantial crowd followed the glowing lantern, their quiet voices reciting verses from their sacred texts, honoring Bimala's contribution towards the village.

Under the sheltering branches of their sacred fig tree, the 'Pipal,’ the procession halted. The 'Jyoti Deep' was strung high on a thick branch, casting an ethereal glow upon the teary-eyed faces below. The tribe believed that upon placing the lantern on Pipal, the soul was provided a radiant guide, and the way to salvation was illuminated.

As the lantern burned through the night, villagers paid their last respects by offering 'Prasad' to the burning lantern, which included Bimala's favorite fruits and sweets. This ceremonial offering was their way of sharing one final earthly meal with Bimala and wishing her soul a peaceful journey.

The following day, upon the 'Jyoti Deep' extinguishing, the tribe assembled for the concluding feast, 'Maha-Bhojan,' where they celebrated Bimala’s life sharing stories, medicinal wisdom, and reliving the love she spread across the community.

Spread across the barren desert landscapes of Odisha, the Bishnoi tribe exemplifies unyielding devotion to nature. Their lifestyle, beliefs, and traditions showcase the intricate relationships they share with the elements. One of their unique death rituals, known as ‘Khejadi Phookna’, or the whispering of the Khejadi tree, embodies their belief in the everlasting bond between life and nature.

Our story is about Ratan, a respected Bishnoi elder who was known widely for his championing of the Khejadi tree. He found solace underneath its shade, he found companionship in its rustling leaves, and found purpose in its protection. When he breathed his last, the tribe came together to convey a heartfelt farewell through ‘Khejadi Phookna’. 

In tandem with their customs, following Ratan's demise, the grieving tribe began the preparation of ‘Phookna'.  In this ritual, the leaves of the Khejadi tree, considered sacred by the Bishnoi, were carefully collected and formed into a sizeable mound.

At sundown, the gathered tribespeople circumambulated the leaf mound. Moving slowly, in rhythm with the poignant hymns echoing in the wind, each person had a handful of leaves from the mound. These leaves were then respectfully placed on Ratan’s body as a sign of blessing for his onward journey.

Post-midnight under the stars, the villagers sat together, their collective whispers carrying prayers and memories of Ratan into the silhouetted Khejdi leaves around them. This imparting of whispers, or 'Phookna,’ was believed to guide his spirit's journey towards oneness with the cosmic spirit of the Khejadi.

After the cremation, the ashes were scattered around the base of Ratan's beloved Khejadi tree, signifying his final return to his cherished companion. The ritual concluded with the ‘Swaha Bhoj,' a communal meal shared in silence, imbued with the tranquillity of Ratan's acceptance into the celestial paradise.

The Bishnoi tribe, through the 'Khejdi Phookna,' celebrates the cyclic journey of life and death, and its rhythmic patterning within nature. The sacred whispering to the Khejadi leaves, the nighttime remembrances, and the shared meals – all collectively help the tribe find comfort and closure in their loss. Though Ratan is gone, his whispers live on in every rustling leaf of the Khejadi - a testament to the tribe’s bond with nature and the eternity of the spirit.

Story28,"Title: The Journey of Spirits: A Ritual of the Saora Tribe, Odisha

In the hilly ranges of Odisha, dwell the Saora tribe, their incipient practices dating back to the Neolithic epoch. Throughout their culture and rituals, runs the narrative of harmony between life and death. Reflected profoundly in their death ritual called 'Idital', it portrays death as an elegant expression of life's continuum.

This tale unfolds with the demise of Bandini, respected as the Saora's Grand Matriarch. Her exceptional botanical knowledge accorded her respect as an intrinsic part of the community's welfare. Her sudden parting plunged the tribe into shared sorrow, ultimately leading to the initiation of 'Idital.'

The 'Idital,' which translates to 'revealing,' started with the 'Ulaka Daan,' the Globe sacrifice. Abiding by the customs, a spherical pot was crafted symbolizing the physical world. This pot held a small amount of grain signifying life's sustenance and meals relished together. It was then placed beside Bandini's body, interpreted as the last worldly offering to the deceased.

Subsequently, Bandini's son took to painting a narrative scroll - ‘Idital.’ On a canvas of cloth, he painted significant episodes of Bandini's life, her achievements, shared moments, and relationships. The painted 'idital' was then displayed in the village, allowing tribe members to commemorate Bandini's life and her contribution to the community.

The evening saw a grand procession, with the 'idital' being carried around the village. The tribe paid respect to Bandini, sharing anecdotes and expressing grief. Simultaneously, they sought her blessings for the tribe's continued wellbeing.

Following the procession, the ceremonial choir, 'Dhunkel,' began. In a symphony of sacred songs and energetic dance, they bade goodbye to Bandini's spirit, believing their collective voice would guide her spirit toward the celestial abode.

Days later, the tribe convened to offer final tributes in a grand feast, 'Utsav Bhoj.' As they shared food and memories, an atmosphere of acceptance prevailed, the tribe finding solace in the celebration of Bandini's life, rather than grief over her departure.

The Saora tribe's 'Idital' death ritual provides a glimpse into their harmonious acceptance of death as a natural corollary of life. The crafted globe pot, narrative scroll ‘idital’, choir songs, and shared meals transform the loss into an affirming celebration of the complete life cycle. Bandini's departure, though physically final, positioned her as an everlasting character in the tribal narrative - her stories and wisdom resounding in the heartbeats of the Saora tribe.

Immersed in the lush serenity of the Mayurbhanj district in Odisha, the Santal tribe safeguards a distinctive cultural heritage interwoven with nature. They view death not as an end, but as a continuation of existence within the cosmos - a belief reverberated in their death ritual, 'Panchatattver Yatra', or the Journey of Five Elements.

Our tale turns to the passing of Sundari, a revered tribal elder, well-known for her gentle spirit and formidable knowledge of local flora. Her abrupt departure left the tribe engulfed in profound melancholy, initiating the 'Panchatattver Yatra', a farewell encompassing the essence of Sundari's life.

The 'Panchatattver Yatra' began with 'Dharitrir Vandana', a ceremonial tribute to Mother Earth. Sundari's family carefully prepared a clay mixture, symbolic of earth – one of the core elements of existence. They made spheres called 'Prithivi Gola' from the mixture, subtly embodying Sundari's essence.

Next, 'Jal Parikrama' was performed, where Sundari's closed ones circumambulated a water-filled earthen urn. The circulating motion indicated the element water's fluidity, serving as an emblem of life's progressed stages and symbolizing emotional depth, as Sundari was known for her empathy.

The subsequent phase involved 'Agni Vandana', a tribute to the element fire - a Purifier and Transformer. A small sacred fire was ignited, and everyone offered rice to it, symbolizing the transformative journey that Sundari's soul was envisaged to undertake.

The fourth phase, 'Hawai Anjali', marked the tribute to air with the release of numerous paper lanterns. As they floated towards the heavens, the tribe felt a release of grief, their prayers elevating with the lanterns, guiding Sundari's spirit to the realm beyond.

The final phase, 'Akasher Deoa,' was offered to space or ether, the all-encompassing element. Sundari’s favourite flowers were launched into the river symbolizing the limitless cosmos, absorbing her soul into the grand entity.

After this, the tribe held a communal feast, 'Maha Prasad', reminiscing about Sundari’s life and the wisdom she shared. Stories about her goodness and her deep understanding of local herbs and their medicinal uses abounded.

Through 'Panchatattver Yatra', the Santal tribe expresses their accord with life's cycle. Each sphere of soil, every circled urn, the rice offering to the sacred fire, floating lanterns, and the launched flowers coalesce to form a beautiful goodbye. This ritual believes that even in death, life perseveres; in the clay of earth, the flow of water, the warmth of fire, the breath of air, and in the vast ether – thereby elemental, eternal, and ever existent."
Story30,"Title: Beneath the Neem, the Farewell Echoes: A Ritual of the Saura Tribe

In the mountainous terrains of Rayagada, Odisha, the Saura tribe - one of the oldest tribal communities in India - has crafted an intimate relationship with nature throughout generations. A testament to this is their unique death ritual called 'Neem Adieu,' a ceremonial process reflecting their profound belief in nature's cyclicality.

Our narrative follows the moving farewell ceremony of Kausalya - a respected weaver known for her intricate 'Parda' sarees. The vibrant colours she poured into her craft mirrored her lively spirit, and her sudden demise left the Saura community enveloped in profound grief. As per their customs, the 'Neem Adieu' was commenced.

The 'Neem Adieu' ritual roots itself in the Saura's profound reverence for the Neem tree - hailed for its medicinal properties and considered the earthly embodiment of their deity 'Dharni-Mata.' Following Kausalya's passing, a fresh branch from a Neem tree was meticulously crafted into a symbolic effigy.

On the third day after her death, Kausalya was taken to the riverbank for her final ablution, her body enshrouded in her finest woven 'Parda' saree. On return, Kausalya's body was placed beneath the sacred Neem tree, and the Neem effigy was raised, casting a comforting shadow. Laying there, it seemed as if she was asleep under the tree she once sought respite beneath after long hours of weaving.

As the tribe gathered around Kausalya and the Neem effigy, a series of elegies known as 'Neem Geets' was sung. Verses soaked in memories of Kausalya's laughter and stories conjured vivid visuals of her journey - from a chirpy girl playing beneath the Neem tree to becoming an accomplished artist, creating ripples in the village's heritage.

The singing continued until Kausalya was ceremonially given to the fire, the Neem effigy standing witness to her transformation from mortal to eternal. As the last flames receded, the Neem effigy was gently toppled, taken by the river's flow, signifying Kausalya's soul freed from earthly reins, riding towards an everlasting voyage.

The 'Neem Adieu' ritual of the Saura tribe symbolizes harmony between life and death. The sacred Neem effigy, soulful Geets, and the concluding water procession marked a cathartic homage to Kausalya's life. Her physical presence might have ceased, but her artistic legacy remains, much like the evergreen Neem tree, a timeless testament to Kausalya’s life in the Saura tribe's lore, and the unending circle of life."
Story31,"Title: The Celestial Voyage: A Ritual of the Gond Tribe in Odisha

Nestled in the verdant valleys of western Odisha, the Gond tribe cherishes an intimate bond with celestial bodies, turning their gaze towards the sky in both their life and death rituals. Therefore, when the benevolent tribal elder, Jayanta, known for his constellation stories, departed for his heavenly abode, it was the ritual of ‘Aakash Yatra’ or The Sky Voyage that was chosen to commemorate his life and passing.

Jayanta, known as the Sky Seer, was the tribe’s astronomer, and his profound knowledge of celestial bodies played an integral role in the tribe’s day-to-day life. His sudden death marked the initiation of ‘Aakash Yatra’, a passage, a voyage that would aid Jayanta’s spirit to find its rightful place with the celestial beings he so often spoke about.

The first stage of the ritual involved the creation of a miniature wooden boat, the 'Akasha Nauka.' Jayanta’s eldest son, with skilled precision and reverence, carved a wooden boat, carefully placing a small lantern inside. This luminous boat was symbolic of the spirit's earthly baggage and was meant to serve as a beacon guiding Jayanta’s soul toward the divine cosmos.

Now, it was time for the ‘Yatra’ to commence. As the twilight sky turned inky, the tribe gathered by the river embankment. Jayanta’s body, dressed in his favorite star gazing attire, was brought forth, the 'Aakash Nauka' glowed vibrantly beside him, casting flickering shadows that danced with the lapping river waves.

As their solemn chants filled the air, the 'Aakash Nauka' was set afloat coinciding with the cremation of Jayanta's mortal remains. With watchful eyes, the tribe looked on as the luminous boat gently drifted away, their hearts heavy with sorrow but filled with the serene belief of Jayanta's safe voyage to his celestial home.

The ritual concluded with the 'Vrihad Bhoj,' a grand communal feast organized twelve days after Jayanta's departure. At this feast, Jayanta’s life was celebrated, his stories retold, and his teachings emphasized, ensuring that his wisdom continued to guide the tribe just like the celestial bodies he once explained about.

The Gond tribe’s ‘Aakash Yatra’ ritual delicately signifies the transition from earthly life to astral existence, providing a comforting perspective of death. The crafting of the 'Akasha Nauka,' the celestial voyage, and the concluding feast served as bridges, connecting life’s ephemeral nature to the constancy of the cosmos. Jayanta may have departed from their sight, but for the Gond tribe, he became an eternal voyager amongst the constellations, forever navigating their lives through his celestial wisdom.

Following the completion of 'Nisi Aradhana,' the tribe immerses into 'Sahabhoj,' a communal feast. Guided by Tara's hymns reverberating in their hearts, they rejoice in her life and teachings over shared meals - turning their mourning into a celebration.

This narrative brings into focus the vibrant tribe's solemn farewell ceremony for Lalit, an elderly farmer revered for his unmatched knowledge of annual crop cycles. His sudden departure echoed a wave of despair through the Bhumia, leading to preparations for the 'Mashaal Phera.'

At the heart of the 'Mashaal Phera' is the majestic torch or 'Mashaal.' Carved out of local bamboo and blessed by the tribe's spiritual leader, the 'Mashaal' is lit from the hearth of Lalit's house.

During this period, they partake in shared meals, recite folk tales, remember their beloved Lalit, thus actively transforming their sorrow into a celebration of Lalit’s exemplary life. 

The 'Mashaal Phera’ ceremony of the Bhumia tribe offers an insight into their deep understanding of the cycle of life and death. It demonstrates that death is not an end but a journey towards a different existence. Lalit's mortal absence did not mark his erasure. Instead, it transitions him into a spiritual, guiding presence that continues to resonate in the tribe’s collective memory, their shared meals, and their narrations chanted under the comforting shade of their ancestral trees.

The 'Manji,' carrying Suryavanshi's body, was then taken on a ceremonial procession to the burning pyre by the river. As the procession advanced, the air filled with elegiac hymns, and the tribe members bid a tearful yet honorable goodbye to their beloved elder.

Post-cremation, the 'Manji' was left to nature, allowing it to decompose and merge back with the sacred earth, while Suryavanshi’s ashes were gently strewn across the holy river – his soul set free on its journey to eternity.

Tucked in the dense Niyamgiri hills of Odisha, the Dongria Kondh tribe has nurtured a profound relationship with their wild homeland. Their intriguing customs combine daily life with an intrinsic spirituality that mirrors in their unique death ritual, known as 'Dharani Parinay,' or the Earthly Union. 

The tale unfolds with the demise of Bhima, the tribe's revered jeweler, famous for making 'Adhania' – tribal jewelry made of brass. Bhima's craftsmanship not only weaved unique designs but also bound the tribe together. His sudden demise left the Dongria Kondhs with a groundswell of sorrow, initiating preparations for his 'Dharani Parinay.'

The 'Dharani Parinay' commenced with 'Bhu Saucha', a purification ritual involving the five elements. A tribesman fetched fresh clay from the nearby river, symbolizing the Earth, while another procured water from a waterfall high in the mountains. From their sacred fire altar, embers were taken, bonding this with air caught in a wind-catch pot - a hollowed-out gourd. Lastly, a small space was hollowed out in the collected clay symbolizing ether or void. Together, these represented the five elements which comprised Bhima's physical existence, ready to assimilate back to the universe.

Next, in a solemn procession, Bhima's body, painted with natural dyes, and adorned in the 'Adhania' he crafted, was carried towards the sacred burial ground, 'Sharadh Gaanv'. As the procession moved, the tribe sang hymns called 'Prakriti Geet,' echoing the surrounding valleys, their collective voices soothing the sadness of parting.

Upon reaching 'Sharadh Gaanv', Bhima's body was wrapped in the leaves of a peepal tree. A pit was dug, and he was gently laid to rest, marking his return to the Earth's bosom. The pit was sealed using the purified clay, signifying Bhima's union with 'Dharani' or Earth, an acceptance of his transformation from mortal life to cosmic energy.

 The 'Dharani Parinay' concluded with 'Prarthana Bhoj,' a community feast, where tribal folks assembled to retell Bhima's tales, to share and relish his favorite dishes. This grief collectively became a celebration of Bhima's life, thus imbibing strength and acceptance.

The Dongria Kondh Tribe, through their 'Dharani Parinay', portrayed a layered understanding of life’s transitory nature. The collection of elements, final journey, gentle burial, and community feast, all symbolized deep acceptance of death not as an end but a transition from a physical form to a celestial entity. Bhima, although not physically present, lived among his tribe in brass jingles of 'Adhania,' the whispered stories, and in the spirit of communal unity.

Within the panoramic borders of the Malkangiri district in Odisha, the Lanjia Saura tribe lives in a harmony with their cosmic beliefs and earthly existence. Their profound respect for ancestors manifests in their unique death ritual, known as ""Ahai Parab"".

Our narrative twines around the peaceful passing of Karishma, an esteemed woman celebrated for her intricate hand-woven shawls. She was known as the Weaving Daiva of the tribe, her demise left the community draped in profound mourning, echoing the sacred call for the 'Ahai Parab' ritual.

The 'Ahai Parab’ or 'ancestor's festival’ represents the tribe's belief in life after death and the deceased's journey to the spiritual realm. The ritual starts with 'Ichhapalli,' the creation of a visual narrative on a sacred wall. An intricately painted mural picturing Karishma's journey from birth to death was prepared. The mural was believed to guide her soul towards the afterlife. 

With the setting sun, the 'Ichhapalli' was completed and the 'Ahai Parab’ festival was ready to commence. Lit by torchlight, the tribe gathered to pay their final respects. The spiritual elder guided them as they performed the folk dance, 'Dhemsa,' a rhythmic tribute to Karishma, the crescendo of their beats echoing into the night sky.

As dawn bathed the village in its soft golden light, the mural was ceremoniously immolated. The tribe believed that the ashes rose and mingled with sunlight, guiding Karishma's spirit towards cosmic unity.

'Ahai Parab’ culminated in 'Samrina Bhojan,' a grand feast celebrated beside the village's sacred tree. Here, the tribe came together to share meals, laughter, and stories about Karishma’s vibrant life, the spirit of their beloved Weaving Daiva living on in their fond remembrances.

The 'Ahai Parab' of the Lanjia Saura tribe speaks volumes about their understanding of the life-death-rebirth cycle. This ritual, with its mural tradition, rhythmic dance, and communal feast, helps the tribe to deal with the sorrow of their loss. While Karishma's physical presence was missed, the rhythm of her loom and the warmth of her woven shawls lived on, binding the community in their shared memory of her, immortalizing the essence of her earthly life within the tribal tales. In this grand cosmic tale, death was not an end, but an ongoing dialogue between the mortal and eternal realms."
Story43,"Title: The Starry Voyage: A Ritual of the Mankidia Tribe 

In the heartland of Odisha's Similipal forest, the Mankidia tribe, well-versed in the language of the wild, has been guarding generations of tribal heritage. Their unique death ritual, 'Tara Prayan', or the Starry Voyage, paints a vivid picture of their cosmic beliefs and life philosophies.

The narrative threads through the life and death of Bhima, a revered storyteller and monkey-hunter within the Mankidia tribe. Known for his tales of brave warriors and fascinating celestial entities, Bhima's unexpected departure left the tribe in deep sorrow. Still, they started with the preparations for 'Tara Prayan.’

'Tara Prayan' asserts the tribe's belief in a parallel celestial existence mimicking earthly life. To aid Bhima's spirit in its celestial journey, 'Talpi,' a distinctive reed mat, was crafted. Bhima's sons undertook the responsibility of crafting it, their fingers emotionally dancing through familiar steps to honor their departed father.

Post the completion of 'Talpi', Bhima's mortal remains, dressed in his favorite tiger-print vestment, were placed atop it. The tribe congregated, solemn silence lingering in the air, for 'Geet Prarthana,’ hymns seeking cosmic blessings for Bhima. As the sky gradually darkened, their synchronized chants echoed under the starlit canvas of the night.

On the following day, Bhima was given his earthly farewell. Once the funeral pyre turned into ashes, the 'Talpi' was ceremonially released onto the placid river – the water body understood as the portal to the celestial realm.

The ritual concluded with 'Akash Bhoj,' a feast held under the open sky where Bhima's tales were retold, his songs sung, and his favorite dishes relished. It was a moment of emotional reconciliation for the tribe, their hearts warmed by the memories of Bhima's wisdom and courage.

The Mankidia tribe, through 'Tara Prayan,' embraces death as a cosmic voyage. The starlit prayers, the ceremonial release of 'Talpi', and the celestial feast transform the mourning period into a celebration of Bhima's life. His physical absence was dearly felt, but his tales, songs, and memories held him close - a star in their sky, a verse in their songs, and a pulse in their shared history. Through their rituals and practices, the tribe reaffirms the belief that life, death, and existence weave an interconnecting tapestry of cosmic and mortal planes."

Story46,"Title: The Journey to the Bamboo Grove: A Santhal Tribe Ritual

Amidst the enchanting Eastern Ghats of Odisha, the Santhal tribe lives in unison with the throbbing heartbeats of the wilderness. Among their plethora of fascinating customs, their death ritual stands out, radiating a sense of tranquillity and acceptance. A notable example is the story of their venerated village healer, Anadi, and the ritual of 'Daru Diyari'.

Renowned throughout for his ethnomedicinal practices, Anadi's sacred healings and stories of medicinal herbs made him a cherished tribal figure. His sudden departure left the Santhal tribe in a grappling pain of loss. However, their belief in life's cyclic journey of birth, death, and rebirth led to the initiation of 'Daru Diyari'.

The central element of the 'Daru Diyari' is the Vanua tree regarded as sacred and an embodiment of their inherent respect for nature. Within hours post Anadi's passing, a robust Vanua tree was chosen as the spiritual totem for the departed spirit. Paying homage to Anadi's contributions, the tribespeople meticulously adorned the tree with streams of colourful cloth and freshly picked marigold flowers.

As the night was embraced by the dawn, the entire tribe convened beneath the adorned Vanua tree, marking the beginning of 'Daru Diyari'. Led by the spiritual elder, they began chanting rhythmic 'Jhawar Geet'. A sense of melancholic tranquillity enveloped the surroundings as they truly began their farewell to Anadi.

Following the chants, the tribe paid their last respects by placing their earthen pots called 'Handia' at the tree's base. They believed the collective offering would provide nourishment to Anadi's spirit during its celestial journey and strengthen its bond with its heavenly companions.

On the thirteenth day marked 'Shanti Bhojan', a ceremonial feast was held. As shared meals and laughter took over the village greens, the essence of Anadi lived on in their memories - his wisdom, warmth, and the echo of his stories becoming one with the rustling leaves of the Vanua tree.

Nestled in the foothills of the Eastern Ghats in Odisha resides the Bhottada tribe. Embracing an intimate bond with nature, their customs reflect on life's essence and the ultimate passage of death. The 'Chinha Daan' or the Footprint Offering is one such death ritual that stands testament to their beliefs about life's cyclical journey.

Our narrative centers around Madhav, the tribal drummer, widely known for his pulsating drum rhythms during festive celebrations. His beats echoed the heartbeats of his tribe, and his stories were commemorated in collective tribal memory. Upon his earthly departure, the tribe initiated the preparations for his 'Chinha Daan.'

'Chinha Daan,' was a solemn, heartful gesture to pay homage to the departed and to keep their memory alive. Nimble fingers collected virgin clay from the sacred river bank, carefully crafting an impression mould. Madhav's son, under the watchful eyes of the elderly tribesman, printed the impressions of Madhav's feet onto the clay mould. The footprints were treated as the sacred symbol of Madhav's life's journey and his return to the divine.

Post the creation of footprints, a sacred procession lead by the village head cladded in traditional tribal attire, moved around the village lanes carrying the clay mould on a locally harvested 'Sal' leaf. The procession came to a halt at a particular 'Saal' tree within the village, a silent witness to the tribal tales spun across generations. 

The tree was adorned with fresh 'Marigold' flowers, and Madhav's drum was respectfully placed at its base. The footprint memento was then affixed to the tree's trunk. The tribe sang and danced around the sacred tree, their celebrations echoing heartfelt remembrance of Madhav's life and contributions.

A few days later, on 'Maghi Purnima,' the tribe congregated once again for 'Maha Bhojan,' a shared feast to mark the completion of the mourning period. During this ceremony, they reminisced about Madhav while relishing the community meal, collectively transforming their sorrow into acceptance.

Through the footprint ritual, the Bhottada tribe celebrates the cycle of life and death, attaching significant value to the mortal journey while acknowledging its inevitable end.

The Kondh Tribe, residing predominantly in the forested slopes of the Eastern Ghats of Odisha, have a peculiar take on life's ephemeral nature, artfully expressed in their distinct death ritual, 'Agni Pravesh,' or the Passage through Fire.

The tale commences with the end of Nanda, a valiant warrior and a revered tribal leader. His bravery and wisdom had shielded the tribe from numerous adversities. Nanda's demise left the Kondh tribe in mourning, preparing for his 'Agni Pravesh' to honor his brave spirit.

'Agni Pravesh,' designed around the tribe's strong belief in life's cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, symbolizes the purification of the departed soul through fire. Following Nanda's passing, the tribe's skilled craftsman sculpted a narrow passage representing the gateway between the mortal and celestial worlds.

The passageway, assembled from stones and bamboo, was lit with sacred fire, signifying 'Agni,' the Vedic god of fire and the divine purifier. Nanda's body, veiled in a white cloth, adorned with floral garlands, was then ceremoniously carried to the fiery passage amidst the chanting of ancestral hymns.

As soon as the twilight sky was set ablaze with scattered starlight, the tribe's spiritual guide initiated the 'Agni Geet,' a rhythmic call to appease Agni. Nanda's body was then carefully carried through the flaming passage, the tribal belief resonating that the sacred fire would purify his spirit and facilitate his journey to the celestial sphere.

Once the ceremonial passage through the sacred fire took place, Nanda's body was cremated while the 'Agni Geet' echoed into the night, the ceremonial fire illuminating the mourning faces with a comforting glow.

On the third day, marking Nanda's journey's completion, the tribe assembled for a grand feast, 'Aahar Divas.' Tasty local dishes prepared from freshly harvested crops were distributed amongst the communities. Sharing food and reminiscing about bravery and tales of Nanda, the tribe found solace, gathered strength, and celebrated life beyond physical existence.

The Kondh Tribe's 'Agni Pravesh' casts an enlightening paradigm on the perception of death, witnessing it as a necessary passage towards heavenly liberation. The flaming gateway, ancestral hymns, and shared meals offer a comforting narrative in which Nanda's spirit passes from life to death and is transformed into a legend retold across generations, thus attesting to the perpetuity of existence beyond mortality.

Story49,"Title: Guided by the River: A Ritual of the Paraja Tribe, Odisha

In the ethereal terrains of Koraput district, Odisha, the Paraja tribe respects profound faith and harmonious coexistence with nature. Among many unique traditions, their death ritual, 'Nadital,' or the River Offering, stands as a tribute to life's infinite voyage from worldly existence to cosmic unity.

Our narrative revolves around the celebrating life and bidding farewell to revered tribal elder, Narayan, known for his unique weather forecasting skills. His precise predictions aided the tribe in farming and proved crucial during seasonal storms. His sudden demise left the Paraja community in grief, marking the commencement of 'Nadital.'

'Nadital' takes its essence from the Paraja belief in guiding the departed soul's journey to the cosmic realm with life's prime element—water. As the customary observance, Narayan's body, adorned with traditional tribal vestment and family heirlooms, was placed on a makeshift bamboo bier. 

Post the sunset, the tribe made a collective offering of silent prayers and fragrant flowers to Narayan. This ceremony, known as 'Pushpa Arpan,' formed the initial phase of the 'Nadital.' The tribe believed that their emotions and sentiments would be carried by the flowers to Narayan's spirit within the cosmic realm. 

Upon the arrival of dawn, the 'Nadi Prayan,' the river journey, commenced. The village carried the flower-adorned bier to the village's sacred river, the river known for its placid water stream being the chosen conduit for Narayan's passage to his next voyage. 

The sight of Narayan’s bier floating away was both heartbreaking and healing for the tribe. The peaceful flow of the river appeared to them as a spiritual medium, deserting the wilderness of death, and embracing the departed elder into a soothing celestial cuddle.

The 'Nadital' concluded with 'Santulan Bhoj,' a communal meal where all villagers came together to remember and recollect the life of Narayan, gently turning their mourning into acceptance. His guidance and weather forecasts outlived him in their shared stories, his spirit’s essence preserved in the river’s persistent flow.

Seen through the 'Nadital,' the Paraja tribe found an enlightened acceptance of death, respecting the end as a part of the life cycle, celebrating the departed’s life, and finding solace in the river's tranquil therapy. Narayan's physical loss was mourned, yet he lived on - in summer's soft breezes, the monsoon's first rain, and every gentle ripple of the sacred river, his life interflows in the tribe's everyday life, crafting the spiritual essence of the Paraja Tribe."

But despite his robust spirit, age caught up with the beloved elder. His departure left a void in the tribe and marked the commencement of the 'Mahaprayaan'.

The ritual of 'Mahaprayaan' was based on the Takri belief that a spirit, upon leaving its earthly abode, embarks on a grand voyage to rejoin the Divine Mother, known as Pita Mata. To lead Arjun's spirit on the right path, a bamboo structure resembling a chariot – the 'Gadi Pathar' – was crafted by the tribal craftsmen. 

The 'Gadi Pathar', symbolizing a cosmic vehicle, was lovingly adorned with fresh flowers plucked from local trees. Arjun's body, dressed in traditional tribal robes, was then placed onto this structure. As the vessel of the spirit, the 'Gadi Pathar' formed an integral part of the ceremony.

At daybreak, led by the mournful rhythm of tribal drums, a procession moved to the edge of the forest. The journey manifested Arjun's final walk amidst the forest he profoundly loved. As the 'Gadi Pathar' made its way through the winding forest path, the tribe sang soulful hymns, and their collective prayers echoed through the wilderness, bidding Arjun a reverential goodbye.

Upon reaching the sacred burial site, the chariot was placed atop a pre-prepared pyre. The ritual reached its peak as the pyre was lit, marking Arjun's spiritual departure from the worldly plane to the higher cosmic realm.

Following the cremation was the 'Anna Prasad,' a grand feast organized in Arjun's honor. The joys of his life, his tales, and teachings were remembered amidst laughter and shared meals. It served as a condolence gathering and an act of collective remembrance that eased the loss of their beloved elder.

'Mahaprayaan' underlies the Takri Tribe's philosophy, viewing the end not as annihilation but as a transition towards a more significant voyage. It crafts a touching tribute for those departed –their Bamboo chariot, forest procession, and the communal feast adding a sense of serenity and closure during the painful transition of death. In memory of Arjun, his tales continued to flourish, his wisdom passed down generations, blending his essence into the tribe's cultural ethos.

Nestled in the lush green valleys of Sundargarh, Odisha, the simple and nature-centric lifestyle of the Birhor Tribe echoes through generations. Their deeply rooted customs and beliefs shape their perception of existence, especially in the case of their unique death ritual known as 'Jyoti Malika', or the Chain of Light.

The narrative centres around the life of Ramu, a tribal elder renowned for his exceptional skills in crafting the traditional rope swings or 'Dorakha.' His passing left a significant void in the Birhor tribe and marked the beginning of the preparations for his 'Jyoti Malika.'

Following Ramu's final rites, the 'Jyoti Malika' is elevated on a bamboo stand near the funeral site. As night falls, each lamp is lit by Ramu's family members, their flickering flames casting a warm glow around the grieving tribe.

To mark the conclusion of the mourning period, a communal feast known as 'Sanjhi Bhoj' is organised. The tribe comes together to reminisce about Ramu's life through shared tales and collective laughter. 

Through 'Jyoti Malika,' the Birhor tribe embraces the concept of the cycle of life and death, viewing the latter as a sacred voyage from the mortal realm to the divine cosmos. The creation of the illuminated chain, the hymn, and the communal feast, all navigate through their sorrow, nurturing remembrance, and acceptance.

Her paintings, packed with tribal folklore, adorned every hut in the village. Yet, time claimed Jumni, leaving the tribe to initiate the ‘Mrittika Sambhadha’ tradition to honor her journey ahead.

To facilitate this journey, an effigy, 'Prithvi Putla,' is crafted from the clay dug out from Jumni's personal land. This effigy represents a massive significance in the ritual, capturing Jumni's spiritual essence and her deep love for artistry.

Post Jumni's last rites, the ‘Prithvi Putla' is brought forth in the village square, under the sacred tamarind tree. The villagers assemble, observing a moment of silence for Jumni's cosmic voyage. Slowly, then volume swells, as they start singing 'Dharti Geet', traditional hymns praising Mother Earth, her abundance, and her relentless nurture.

The songs led by the tribal elder resonate with a rhythm that seems to echo Jumni's presence amongst them. Each melody pulsates with an energetic vibe of unity, love, and respect for Mother Earth - elements that defined Jumni's existence.

After the songs, Jumni's ‘Prithvi Putla’ is ceremoniously carried by her family to a freshwater river nearby. As the day descends towards twilight, they release the effigy into the serene water. This immersion ritual marks the final process of Jumni's soul uniting with Earth, completing the circle of life and death.

The ritual concludes with the community gathering for a feast, ‘Anna-Santhali.’ Traditional cuisines are prepared, stories are shared, laughter rings through the air, and Jumni’s life is celebrated, allowing acceptance, recovery, and remembrance to flourish in the village.

The ‘Mrittika Sambhadha’ of the Savara tribe celebrates the cycle of life and death, illustrating the transient nature of existence. Through the clay effigy, the earthly songs, and the immersion ritual, the tribe perceives death not as an end but as a transformation from one form of existence to another.

Firm believers of harmonious co-existence with nature, their blend of human and spiritual confluence is most vivid in their unique death ritual referred to as ‘Aakash Sweekar’ or the Embrace of the Sky.

His soulful tunes offered solace and unity within his community. However, Baldev's peaceful transition into the silent realm of death led the tribe on the path of their mourning ceremony, the 'Pavan Marga.'

The practice of 'Pavan Marga' focuses on guiding the departed soul on its journey towards the divine through nature's elements, in this case, the wind. To aid Baldev's ascension, his beloved 'Tar-Shehnai' was chosen, mirroring his love for music and his earthly existence.

As the chilling twilight draped over the hamlet, the villagers gathered around the sacred 'Peepal' tree. Baldev’s 'Tar-Shehnai' was laid at its foot, the tribe's collective silence a reverent nod towards his peaceful passage. The spiritual elder of the tribe then initiated the 'Vital Vayu Mantra', seeking the wind's blessing for Baldev's onward voyage.

As the mantra continued to echo in the silent night, a flowy dance named 'Vayu Vallari' was performed around the tree. Their synchronized movements around the 'Peepal' tree and the collective rhythm of the dance formed a serene spectacle under the twinkling stars.

With dawn's first light, Baldev's 'Tar-Shehnai’ was tied to a bouquet of vibrant helium balloons. The tribe then released this buoyant remembrance into the rising day, marking the conclusion of Baldev's earthly ties and the beginning of his celestial journey.

The ritual comes to a peaceful end with 'Aahar Vishram,' a shared feast, featuring Baldev’s favourite dishes. The tribe recalled stories of Baldev as they dined, his lingering melodies reverberating through their shared laughter, silent tears and affectionate remembrances.

Through 'Pavan Marga', the Dom tribe recognizes death as a mere transition into another realm governed by the divine. The 'Tar-Shehnai', the wind dance, the release of the balloons symbolise the tribe’s collective journey in allowing their grief to transform into acceptance and unity. Although Baldev may be absent in presence, he continues to live through his melodies, which whisper in the rustling leaves of the 'Peepal' tree, reimaging the timeless saga of life and death."

Nestling within the undulating landscapes of the Koraput district, the Bhil Tribe coexist with nature's raw beauty. Their tribal norms frame a uniquely touching interpretation of the life-death spectrum, especially cumulating their death ritual, known as 'Paav Chaleo' or The Final Footsteps.

This narrative embraces the life and ultimate passage of Amol, revered in the tribe as the 'Wayfarer.' His ability to traverse the forest and guide the tribe through unexplored routes was indispensable to their survival. His sudden departure into the realm of quietus, however, cast a veil of grief upon the tribe, embarking them on the preparations for his 'Paav Chaleo.’

As the sun set, the tribe took Amol's walking stick and gathered around their sacred fig tree, their sacred deity’s shrine. The tribe's oldest member initiated the 'Rakkh Abhimaan,' a prayer invoking the celestial gods to guide Amol's soul onto his journey into the cosmos.

As the evening haze arrived, the tribe danced their traditional 'Aakasha Nritya,' their movements expressing their shared sense of loss,'respect and loving remembrance of their wayfarer. The day culminated under the twinkling stars, with Amol's walking stick carried to the village outskirts by his eldest son.

The next day at dawn, the stick was set adrift in the 'River Kaina,' a river running alongside their dwelling. This represented the initiation of Amol's soul's journey towards his heavenly abode.

The ceremony concluded with 'Margadarshak Bhoj,' a grand feast of Amol's favorite dishes, instilling acceptance and shared memory of his teachings. His envisioned paths and vibrant tales of his forest exploration were shared, invoking laughter and healing tears among the tribe members.
