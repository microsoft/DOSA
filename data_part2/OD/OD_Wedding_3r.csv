Radha, standing as beautiful as a goddess in her red and gold bridal lehenga straight from the looms of Sambalpur, looked every bit the perfect Odiya bride. Her eyes adorned with kohl reflected the plethora of emotions she was experiencing. Krishna, on the other hand, with palpable excitement on his face, dressed in a traditional white dhoti and kurta, was eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of his bride.

Just when the sky started to bleed hues of red and orange, the dhol nishaan began, indicating the groom's procession was approaching.

The men of the household were engrossed in ensuring every detail was perfect.

Upon arrival, Krishna was greeted with a ritual known as 'Baadua Pani Gadhua'. Radha's mother playfully tried to prevent him from entering, teasing him and demanding a 'gift' to let him proceed. After a few light-hearted moments and an envelope exchange, Krishna was granted entry amidst the cheerful laughter of the crowd.

Subsequently, the couple was seated before the sacred holy fire amidst chanting of the sacred hymns by the priest. This marked the beginning of the key ritual - 'Kanyadaana', where Radha's father gave her hand to Krishna, signifying he was entrusting his daughter's well-being to him. This solemn moment filled the air with reverence, as everyone sent their blessings with moist eyes.
