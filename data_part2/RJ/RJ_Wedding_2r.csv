Story0,"In the sun-drenched state of Rajasthan, renowned for color-drenched costumes and splendid forts, preparations were on in full swing for the wedding of Nandini, the only daughter of the Rajpurohit family.

Nandini and her childhood sweetheart, Kailash, were betrothed when they were merely teenagers. They loved each other with a passion that could be compared only with the simmering heat of their native land. The day they had long dreamt of was finally nearing. The undulating sand dunes served as the backdrop to the splendid decor of their 100-year-old haveli.  
 
The aroma of marigolds entwined with rose petals filled the air, as vibrant carpets and shamiana were laid out. The groom's friends, adorned in traditional turbans and crisp bandhgalas, practiced the 'ghoomar’, a traditional Rajasthani dance, to perform during the ‘sangeet’ night.

Arrangements for the bride's ‘mehendi’ ritual were impressive; henna artists from across the state were summoned. Nandini sat splendid in a bright orange lehenga, studded with precious gems and embroidery as intricate as the frescoes on the walls of Rajasthan's forts. As the designs enveloped her hands and feet, she was a sight to behold.

Meanwhile, Kailash was busy in a ritual of his own – the ‘sehra bandi’, where his face was covered with a floral veil, held by a glittering, traditionally embroidered turban. His traditional Rajputi attire consisted of a cream satin sherwani decked with royal red and gold zari work, with an antique gold talwar tied sideward as per tradition. His bright, lively eyes conveyed his impatience and thrill.

The wedding procession started under the brilliantly starlit sky, the groom, atop an ornately decorated mare, was led by a vibrant procession, 'baraat', with music from traditional dhol & nagada rising like crescendo against the serene silence of the desert. He was surrounded by his friends and family, who danced with unfettered joy, illuminating the cool desert night with their radiance.

The bride's mother carried the sacred 'aarti thali' and carried out the 'tilak' ceremony for the groom, symbolizing his acceptance into the family. The bride, glowing under the twinkling ghungats, stole shy glances of her to-be husband.

The happy couple was led to the floral decorated canopy, the mandap, where they sat before the holy fire, 'Agni'. Their hands were joined by the bride's father as he formally gave away his dear daughter in the 'kanya-daan' ceremony. The echoes of the ‘mantras’ chanted filled the night, as the couple took the seven vows promising love and loyalty to each other, circling the fire to ratify their marriage.

This was followed by the ‘sindoor daan’ ceremony where Kailash, with a loving look in his eyes, applied the vermilion powder in Nandini's hair parting. The final act came with the “Mangalsutra Bandhan” where Kailash tied the sacred thread around Nandini’s neck, completing their unison.

Underneath the ancient stars, Kailash and Nandini, the now-joined souls, made promises to each other in whispers, their joy reflecting in the other's eyes. As they stepped into their new lives, there was a resounding cheer from both the families. The desert echoed with happy songs.

In the heart of Rajasthan, love had sealed another timeless tale amidst the golden dunes, a wedding that emulated the richness and culture of Rajputs.
