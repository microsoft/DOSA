Almost like a fairytale in sun-drenched skies over the sandy landscape of Marwar region, Rajasthan, two souls from different castes were united, breaking societal norms and stirring the still waters of tradition. Meera, a gifted Kalbelia dancer, was to wed Raghav, a respected potter from the kshatriya Prajapat caste. 

Meera was known far and wide for her captivating dance. Her grace coiled and uncoiled like the hypnotic rhythm of a serpent, characteristic of the Kalbelia community's dance form. On the other hand, Raghav belonged to the Prajapat caste, respected for their skills in pottery, their hands breathing life and purpose into mounds of clay.

Theirs was a chance meeting during the time of the Pushkar mela, but it bloomed into a love that was deep, inevitable and unfettered by societal boundaries.

The ceremony began with the exchange of Jaimala, a garland of fresh, fragrant flowers, woven together signifying their unity and mutual respect. Laughters and cheers punctuated the air as they tried to outdo each other while garlanding.

The remarkable moment was the Saat-phera, with the couple walking around the holy fire solemnizing their wedding vows.

The elders blessed them, and a sense of peaceful contentment washed over all who witnessed this singular communion.

As they walked hand in hand as man and wife amidst the ruins of tradition and caste-creations, the dunes of Marwar reverberated with the hauntingly melodious folk songs, sung in their honour.
