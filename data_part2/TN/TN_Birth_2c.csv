Lakshmi’s birth in the soaring summer heat marks a moment of joy and honor for her family in Kanchipuram, the thriving cultural hub of Tamil Nadu. The fourth day following her birth, a momentous event is crafted, marking her first rite of passage. The ritual begins early in the morning, with the first light piercing through the encircling coconut groves that outline their ancestral home. The tranquil air vibrates with the harmonious chants of sacred hymns by the family's priest, who hails from the Brahmin caste.
